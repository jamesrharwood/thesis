# Intended Methods

<!-- # ASK: could someone sit in to do data recording? 
Can I avoid recording and coding full interviews? I don't think so.
I could record both interviews. Do I need to manually transcribe them?
How long will transcription take? 
Do I need to code line by line, or can I just code problems? How long will coding take?
-->

## Pre test questionnaire

* Discipline
* Experience level (years)
* Sector of work (e.g. academia, industry, clinician)
* English proficiency (self reported?)
* Location

## Immediate understanding of and feelings towards the intervention

* 5 second test
  * Describe in your own words what you think the website is about
  * (If they just say reporting guidelines, ask) "what do you think RGs are?"
  * When do you think you would use RGs?
  * How do you think this website would affect your work?
  * What words would you use to describe how the site looked? Why did you choose that word?

Record: mis- or non-understandings, negative feelings or descriptions.
<!-- # ASK: Is there value in recording positive responses too? -->
Yes - record positive responses too. They will add context.

## Ability to use and find information

* User protocol. Give the user scenarios and ask them to think aloud as they find the relevant information.
* Can be used to troubleshoot:
  * Website functions "Imagine you want to leave a comment"
  * Finding guidance "Imagine you are doing [a study description], find the most appropriate guidance."
  * Finding information within a guideline including, what to write, why it is important, when it is important, etc.

Record: moments of confusion & wrong turns

## Authors' feelings towards the guidance itself

* Plus - minus method & retrospective interview
  * Will also catch parts of the text the author doesn't understand
* Writing check (aka performance test) & retrospective interview
  * to catch mis-understanding

Record:

* Quotes of text that elicited negative responses, and the reasons for those responses
<!-- # ASK: What would I do with the plus parts? If nothing, is there point in collecting them? -->
* Reasons for non-compliance

[Usability of documents](https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2020/05/how-to-test-the-usability-of-documents.php)

[Text Evaluation Goals and Methods](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/epdf/10.1177/1050651997011004003) by de Jong and Schellens
Includes selection, comprehension, application, acceptance, appreciation and relevance.

Evaluation methods can:

* Verify the quality of a document (against a baseline or standard)
* troubleshoot and improve a document
* facilitate choice between alternatives

Transcription costs:

£3-4 for 1 minute of data!

So if each participant took 90 min then that would cost:

£270-360 per participants.

An alternative could be TRINT or Zoom - AI transcript software. Check University rule.
