## Box: Reflexivity on the importance of tone

* "Waste", "Questionable research practices", "Risk of bias", "Poorly reported", "don't meet standards". Research "has" integrity or it doesn't. I've used some of them.
* Vilify the researcher.
* What if we flip the script and frame our work as helping researchers do their job to a standard they aspire to?
* First I think this message is much easier to engage with, much less off-putting than "your PhD was a waste of time and tax payers money".
  * No health care interventionist would recommend shaming patients into losing weight.
* Secondly I think phrasing better reflects the truth - people are trying their best, but have different limitations, and that perhaps excellence looks different according to your philosophical starting point, discipline, or tradition.
  * As an exmaple I can use myself and EQUATOR. Didn't even know which guideline to use! First pass at thematic analysis was much improved by Charlotte. I tried my hardest to design and report my work well, but there will be things I could improve. 
  * And beyond EQUATOR, meta-researchers are wrong to think they are on a pedestal. Ratcheting up the meta-dial:
    * [Example](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.12.19.22283669v1.full-text) - meta science studies looking at reporting are themselves poorly reported and wasteful.
  * Finally, best practice changes over time. We, as meta-researchers, might be quite good at keeping up with changing expectations and best practices. But what woudl happen if we changed field? Or became 'out of touch' with expectations? By creating a culture where we shame and blame researchers for not meeting _our_ expectations, we are setting ourselves up for the same treatment when our own practices fall behind the times.
