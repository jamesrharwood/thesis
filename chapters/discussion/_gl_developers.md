# Are GL developers supportive?

Buy in. 
- Necessary 
- Experience positive but engagement limited
- Will all developers feel similarly?
- Some may feel protective over their writing. Writing done by committee. But confidence not necessarily justified with evidence from testing. 
- Hopefully reassured by my structured approach to editing guideline content and by evidence from piloting this new structure with authors.
- A reporting guidelines for writing reporting guidelines could be useful (and very meta)


My experience of working with GL developers during this study.

Barriers include motivation (don't believe anything needs to change), opportunistic (time, funding, and people), and capability (don't know how to test their work, don't know how to design a tool, or make a website).

Motivation:

Some may believe that because the writing was finalised through consensus, the phrasing and content is therefore perfect and should not be changed. Personally I believe this confidence is misplaced, especially when the consenses group was not representative of the user base, and when user testing was skipped or done poorly.

Opportunity:

Funding. Need long term funding to evaluate and revise guidance. This new website could help support applications because we solicit feedback. Ready-made evidence gatherer to identify areas in need of improvement. 

Long term funding to support service provision. E.g. New CONSORT website as an example, they need to pay all costs up front.

Equally, could support a shift towards community-driven resources.

Capability:

Example - CONSORT and PRISMA websites went down.
GL teams don't include specialists in product development, copy writing, or even novice researchers.
Don't know how to run qualitative studies to evaluate and refine resources.
Pilot testing advice and dissemination advice not included in guidance for developers.
