# Introduction

In chapter {{< var chapters.bcw >}} I described the Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW) framework for designing behavioural interventions @michieBehaviourChangeWheel2011. In {{< var chapters.workshops >}} I summarised the stages recommended in Michie et al.'s accompanying book @michieBehaviourChangeWheel2014 for using the framework to develop interventions. I also described the additions that I made to step 7 of this approach where, in addition to considering each behaviour change technique for each desired change myself (as recommended), I also asked EQUATOR UK staff to brainstorm ideas more loosely. I did this because considering 93 techniques for {{ var counts.barriers }} was too time consuming to do as a group, and EQUATOR staff did not have time to become familiar with the behaviour change technique taxonomy. The result of this brainstorm was a list of {{< var counts.EQUATOR_ideas >}} ideas. In this chapter, I describe how I extended this list of ideas by seeking input from the broader reporting guideline community into this ideation phase.

I did this because, although EQUATOR staff have a lot of experience in reporting guidelines (which I describe in chapter {{< var chapters.workshops >}}), the group is small and close-knit. Whilst EQUATOR is a key part of the reporting guideline landscape, they are _only_ a part of it. Ultimately, all stakeholders within the academic system influence the impact of reporting guidelines. Guideline developers and publishers arguably do so most directly currently, and so it was important to draw on their experience and opinions. 

It wasn't feasible to include these stakeholders through all stages of the BCW approach as a) the time commitment was too great, b) it would have required stakeholders to become familiar with the framework and its terminologies which was too big an ask. 

In contrast, adding an idea-generating step provided a good opportunity to include stakeholders. Stakeholders could contribute and discuss ideas in a short amount of time and without having to study the Behaviour Change Wheel or behaviour change technique taxonomy. In this chapter, I describe how I gathered ideas from guideline developers, publishers, and other experts.

<!-- Although some EQUATOR members have developed reporting guidelines, their experience may not be representative of "external" guideline developers who, despite having a deep understanding of their own guidance, may consider reporting guidelines as a small part of their academic identity and may not "live and breathe" reporting guidelines in the same way EQUATOR does. -->
