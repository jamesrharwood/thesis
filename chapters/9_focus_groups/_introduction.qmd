# Introduction

In chapter {{< var chapters.workshops >}} I described how I led EQUATOR UK staff members through the stages recommended in Michie et al.'s book "The Behaviour Change Wheel - A Guide to Designing Interventions" @michieBehaviourChangeWheel2014. I also described why I added an "ideas generation" step before step 7 (identifying behaviour change techniques) which drew on the outcomes of workshop stage 4 (listing things that need to change for our desired behaviour to come about. See @fig-modified-bcw-stages). This chapter describes that additional step in more detail.

The purpose of this additional step was to gather ideas from the reporting guideline community on how to address reporting guideline limitations. I wanted to gather ideas from the UK EQUATOR staff and also other stakeholders including guideline developers and publishers. I wanted to include this broader community because, although EQUATOR is a key part of the reporting guideline landscape, they are _only_ a part of it. Ultimately, all stakeholders within the academic system influence the impact of reporting guidelines. Guideline developers and publishers arguably do so most directly currently, and so it was important to draw on their experience and opinions. I expected that seeking input from a more diverse group would lead to _more_ ideas and that those ideas would be more likely to gain traction. It hadn't been feasible to include these stakeholders through all stages of the BCW approach as a) the time commitment was too great, b) it would have required stakeholders to become familiar with the framework and its terminologies which was too big an ask. In contrast, brainstorming ideas was a convenient and important stage to include them in.

<!-- Although some EQUATOR members have developed reporting guidelines, their experience may not be representative of "external" guideline developers who, despite having a deep understanding of their own guidance, may consider reporting guidelines as a small part of their academic identity and may not "live and breathe" reporting guidelines in the same way EQUATOR does. -->
