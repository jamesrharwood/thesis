**Techniques for establishing credibility**|
*Member-checking*|Lincoln and Guba argue that member checking is the most important way to the establish validity of an account @lincolnNaturalisticInquiry1985. Accordingly, I invited participants to comment on my synthesised results, asking for feedback on the structure of categories, my interpretation of their data, and my findings and conclusions. I also 3 invited participants to comment on the product of my data analysis in the form of itemized information and condensed notes.
*Peer debriefing*|Throughout the design, data collection, analysis and reporting, CA acted as a disinterested peer<!--#ASK true?-->. By questioning my reasoning and exploring my assumptions, she helped me become aware of biases, perspectives that I was taking for granted, and assumptions I was making. JdB acted as a disinterested peer during data analysis.<!--#ASK true?-->
**Techniques for establishing transferability**|
*Thick description*|I aspired to report my results with context by indicating when ideas were common or rare, and who they originated from when I felt this was particularly relevant. I reported disagreements, provide quotes, and relationships between ideas.
**Techniques for establishing confirmability**|
*Audit trail*|I referred to audio recordings of the focus groups whenever he needed to clarify parts of the document<!--#ASK Unsure if this should go here-->. I kept versions of raw data collected from all stages. I made a note of my own ideas before commencing data collection, documented all stages of the workshops I held internally with the EQUATOR Network, and kept copies of the co-produced file after every focus group. I kept a copy of my coding in NVivo, and versions of the unitized information and summaries that I sent to participants before and after member checking. This audit trail meant that I could be certain of which stages of research ideas originated from.
*Reflexivity*|I wrote down my own ideas before commencing the study (see chapter {{< var chapters.workshops >}}), along with my beliefs and experiences of reporting guidelines. I continued to keep personal notes throughout planning, data collection, analysis and reporting, in an attempt to remain aware of my own perspectives and positions, and how they may influence my research.

<!-- |**Techniques for establishing dependability**|
|Inquiry audit Could do #ASK. "External audits involve having a researcher not involved in the research process examine both the process and product of the research study.  The purpose is to evaluate the accuracy and evaluate whether or not the findings, interpretations and conclusions are supported by the data."| -->

<!-- 
   * Data reduction and analysis products - including summaries such as condensed notes, unitized informaiton and quantitative summaries and theoretical notes
    * Data reconstruction and synthesis products - including structure of categories (themes, definitions, and relationships), findings and conclusions and a final report including connections to existing literatures and an integration of concepts, relationships, and interpretations

" Definition

This is when data, analytic categories, interpretations and conclusions are tested with members of those groups from whom the data were originally obtained.

This can be done both formally and informally as opportunities for member checks may arise during the normal course of observation and conversation.

Typically, member checking is viewed as a technique for establishing to the validity of an account. 

Lincoln and Guba posit that this is the most crucial technique for establishing credibility.  However, this technique is controversial.

* Peer debriefing

Definition

"It is a process of exposing oneself to a disinterested peer in a manner paralleling an analytical sessions and for the purpose of exploring aspects of the inquiry that might otherwise remain only implicit within the inquirer's mind" (Lincoln & Guba, 1985, p. 308)

Purpose of debriefing

through analytical probing a debriefer can help uncover taken for granted biases, perspectives and assumptions on the researcher's part
through this process the researcher can become aware of his/her posture toward data and analysis
this is an opportunity to test and defend emergent hypotheses and see if they seem reasonable and plausible to a disinterested debriefer
provide the researcher with an opportunity for catharsis

Not done: 

* Prolonged Engagement
* Persistent Observation
* Triangulation
* Peer debriefing
* Negative case analysis
* Referential adequacy

kept personal notes 
* Reflexivity: "Reflexivity is an attitude of attending systematically to the context of knowledge construction, especially to the effect of the researcher, at every step of the research process. 

"A researcher's background and position will affect what they choose to investigate, the angle of investigation, the methods judged most adequate for this purpose, the findings considered most appropriate, and the framing and communication of conclusions" (Malterud, 2001, p. 483-484).

The perspective or position of the researcher shapes all research - quantitative, qualitative, even laboratory science."

Not done: 
* triangulation - not done. 
* Confirmability audit (basically same as inquiry audit) -->
