<p>I sent <strong>?var:counts.invitations.total</strong> invitations. <strong>?var:counts.invitations.no_response</strong> received no response, ad those that responded sometimes copied in colleagues that they felt may be interested. Because I invited people to share the invitation, I have no way of knowing my recruitment rate. Of the <strong>?var:counts.invitations.guideline_groups.total</strong> guideline groups I invited, <strong>?var:counts.invitations.guideline_groups.attended</strong> took part. Only <strong>?var:counts.invitations.guideline_groups.denied</strong> group refused to participate (their reason was that their guideline was highly cited and so, presumably, did not need improving). <strong>?var:counts.invitations.guideline_groups.no_time</strong> guideline groups wanted to participate but were unable to coordinate a time, and <strong>?var:counts.invitations.guideline_groups.no_response</strong> groups did not respond.</p>
<p><strong>?var:counts.participants</strong> participants attended one of <strong>?var:counts.focus_groups</strong> focus groups. Participants included guideline developers (n=<strong>?var:counts.guideline_developers</strong>), publishing professionals (n=<strong>?var:counts.publishers</strong>), and academics that study reporting guidelines (n=<strong>?var:counts.academics</strong>).</p>
<p>Before the focus groups, I had made a note of my own ideas (n=<strong>?var:counts.jh_ideas_before</strong>). The internal workshops with EQUATOR grew this list to <strong>?var:counts.EQUATOR_ideas</strong> ideas which were included in the initial “ideas list” document presented to the first focus group. After the final focus group, participants had extended this list further to include <strong>?var:counts.sub_items_pre_jh</strong> ideas to address <strong>?var:counts.barriers</strong> barriers. I grouped these ideas into <strong>?var:counts.ideas</strong> broader ideas, which I categorised according to whether they could be considered <strong>?var:descriptions.stages</strong>. Participants identified <strong>?var:counts.stakeholders</strong> stakeholders that could enact these ideas including <strong>?var:descriptions.stakeholders</strong>.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="var-ifs.avoid-proliferation"><strong>?var:IFs.avoid-proliferation</strong></h4>
<p>“We need fewer, better, reporting guidelines” wrote one participant, when discussing how authors may struggle to identify which of the 500+ reporting guidelines apply to their work. Authors can be confused when multiple guidelines exist for a type of research, and can find it difficult to reconcile multiple sets of guidance.</p>
<p>Because reporting guideline developers may duplicate each other’s work unwittingly, participants wrote that developers should consult EQUATOR’s register of reporting guidelines under development before creating a new guideline.</p>
<p>Sometimes a developer wishes to tailor existing guidance to a particular use-case or research niche, and participants had ideas of how this could be done in user-friendly ways. The first was to consider creating “modular” guidance. Participants spoke of modules in two different ways. Firstly, new reporting guidelines can be created to substitute for particular items in existing reporting guidelines. Participants named TIDIER as an example of this strategy, which can be substituted for item 5 in CONSORT. Participants identified a second kind of modularity in the JARS guidelines, where a general reporting guideline covering all quantitative psychology research can be mixed-and-matched by modules for specific designs (non-experimental and experimental designs, with or without random assignment, or special modules for longitudinal, n-of-1, or replication studies (#REF). When modules aren’t sufficient, participants suggested making “versions” or “extensions” of existing guidance “e.g., STROBE split into STROBE Cohort, Case-control etc”.</p>
<p>Participants wrote that guideline developers could “harmonize” resources so that they “speak to another”, have compatible structure, and don’t “use different wording for what is essentially the same item”. Participant’s recommendation to “use similar terminology [across] related guidelines” extends to the title; STROBE-nut, STROBE-ME and STROBE-RDS are more readily identifiable as STROBE extensions than STREGA, ROSES-I, or STROME-ID are. Naming can also indicate when a guideline has been revised: “ARRIVE 2.0” is recognisable as a replacement of “ARRIVE”, whereas “TIDIER Placebo” appears to be an extension but “should be called TIDIER 2.0”.</p>
<p>Participants noted that “EQUATOR cannot prevent guideline developers from creating duplicate guidelines or narrow extensions” but could “improve the registration process for RGs that are under development”, better “highlight [reporting guidelines] that are under development in the main search results”, and could “create options and instructions to encourage developers to extend existing guidance instead of duplicating. This could go in the new guidance for guideline developers”.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="var-ifs.design-agnostic"><strong>?var:IFs.design-agnostic</strong></h4>
<p>Participants recognised that <em>designing</em> research is a separate task to <em>reporting</em> it, and that many authors will only encounter reporting guidelines <em>after</em> the manuscript has been written, at which point design advice is less useful. Nevertheless, participants cited multiple reasons for including design opinions in reporting guidance. Often it was included so that authors can “learn for next time”, and this was why some developers felt keen to continue imparting design advice. Other times it is used to justify an item’s importance: <em>you need to explain how you did X because studies that don’t do X risk Y</em>. Sometimes design assumptions were implicit because developers may not consider all contexts or study types in which their guidance may be used.</p>
<p>Some felt that design advice could be removed from reporting guidelines entirely. This was proposed as a solution when considering authors can feel afraid to report transparently if what they did goes against the design recommendation, and other authors can feel restricted if forced to use a reporting guideline that prescribes design choices. Participants wrote that developers should “encourage transparent reporting over and above good design”, and that they could could “reassure researchers (and remind editors) that guidelines are just that: guidelines!”<!--consider removing-->. Instead, developers could encourage authors to “explain reasons for methods choices, [which may] be legitimate, and the consequence of not choosing one option over another, even if the choice is a rarely used option, may not have major consequence on the results of the study”, noting that “Editors and peer-reviewers may not judge as harshly when they understand the rationale for the choice”. Authors could be encouraged to “describe what they did in plain language to make it clear - if what they did doesn’t quite fit with standard terminology (e.g., if they didn’t really do theoretical sampling or aren’t sure if they did theoretical sampling) then just describe what they did, how they made sampling decisions”.</p>
<p>Discussions about removing design advice also arose when considering how including design advice elongates guidance, potentially deterring authors from reading it. To solve this, participants suggested reporting guidelines could link to design resources “elsewhere”. If reporting guidance were presented on a website, authors could be given options to “display or hide” design advice, and could be displayed differently depending on whether the author was “designing [research], applying for funding, or drafting” a manuscript.</p>

<section id="var-ifs.item-content" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="var-ifs.item-content"><strong>?var:IFs.item-content</strong></h4>
<p>Many barriers prompted participants to suggest content to include for every reporting item.</p>
<p>Firstly, authors need to know what to write. Participants noted that a brief description could go in checklists and a longer description in the full guidance. Participants suggested this description should include what to write if they didn’t or couldn’t do something to make it “easy for researchers to report things they are embarrassed about”. In these instances, developers could suggest authors “explain reasons” for their choices or “consider the item in their discussion section as a possible limitation” if necessary. Participants also wrote that developers could suggest what to write when an item doesn’t apply.</p>
<p>Besides knowing what to write, participants suggested explaining “why [an item] is important and who it is important to” as this isn’t always obvious to authors. To make guidelines faster to use, participants suggested indicating which items are most important, perhaps “prioritise[ing] certain items as essential vs.&nbsp;recommended, like ARRIVE 2.0 essential 10” and indicating conditions that make items less or more important, including circumstances that make the item non-applicable.</p>
<p>To help authors who want to keep writing concise, participants suggested advising “when an item can be put into a table, figure, box, supplement, or appendix etc” and to “explain the pros and cons of different options e.g., whether content will be peer reviewed or indexed” by search tools.</p>
<p>Many participants suggested using examples to help authors understand and apply guidance. These examples could include both “good and bad reporting” with an explanation of “how [bad reporting] could be improved”. To help authors who are afraid to transparently report limitations, participants suggested including examples of imperfect research that is perfectly-reported. Examples could also include “reporting in different contexts”, from different disciplines, “in multiple languages”, and concise reporting e.g.&nbsp;reporting “TIDIER items nicely in a table”.</p>
<p>Because examples from the published literature can be “difficult to […] find and list”, participants suggested that developers could create examples themselves, noting that examples could be “real or generated”. Examples should be “easy to find” from within the guidance resources. Others suggested a searchable “bank” of examples, or ways to showcase “exemplar papers (e.g., badges)”.</p>
<p>Finally, participants discussed the pros and cons of including item-specific design advice, procedural instructions, and appraisal advice, and the different ways of doing it (see <a href="@sec-?var:IFSecs.design-agnostic"><strong>?var:IFs.design-agnostic</strong></a>).</p>

<section id="var-ifs.rg-introductions" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="var-ifs.rg-introductions"><strong>?var:IFs.rg-introductions</strong></h4>
<p>When considering what information an author needs to understand which reporting guideline they should use, participants wrote that reporting guidelines and resources should “clearly state what kind of research the guidance applies to” and “point researchers to other guidelines if more relevant, perhaps using ‘if, then’ rules e.g., ‘if you did X then use Y instead of this guideline’”.</p>
<p>If no better guideline exists for a particular type of study, participants suggested to “warn the user that they can still use this guideline but that they may need to ignore certain questions e.g.&nbsp;‘This guideline is for studies that did X. You can still use it if you did Y, but you will need to ignore items 4, 6, and 8-10’”.</p>
<p>Similarly, to ensure that a reporting guideline for writing manuscripts can also be used for writing protocols, developers could specify “which items need to be considered at protocol/planning stage, and which at results reporting stage.”</p>
<p>Participants suggested stating the guideline’s “aim”. This could also be reflected in the guideline’s name, when considering whether to use words like <em>guideline</em>, <em>standard</em>, or <em>template</em> etc, which may influence how prescriptive the user expects the resource to be. Developers could “be clear about what reporting guidelines <em>are not</em>. For instance, when they are not design guideline or critical appraisal tools” this could be specified and authors could be directed to other tools instead.</p>
<p>Finally, participants suggested telling authors how much time the guideline is expected to take them to read and use, why it can be trusted, and where they can read about its development.</p>

<section id="var-ifs.keep-short" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="var-ifs.keep-short"><strong>?var:IFs.keep-short</strong></h4>
<p>“Make guidance shorter” wrote one participant, and “Make checklists shorter ;P”, wrote another, when considering how “guideline length […] may put researchers off” as “long guidelines appear more complex and time consuming” and can challenge word limits.</p>
<p>Some felt that guidelines could be shorter if developers were “realistic about what they ask for”. One participant challenged developers to “try using a guideline from start to finish and see how the manuscript ends up”. Others felt that guidelines could be shortened by linking out to content that wasn’t directly related to reporting, like design or appraisal advice (see <a href="@sec-?var:IFSecs.design-agnostic"><strong>?var:IFs.design-agnostic</strong></a>). Guidelines that are “very long or [have] lots of optional items” could be split into multiple versions (see STROBE as an example in <a href="@sec-?var:IFSecs.avoid-proliferation"><strong>?var:IFs.avoid-proliferation</strong></a>).</p>
<p>Others suggested presenting guidance online with non-essential content collapsed so that authors could choose to “display or hide” it. Participants noted that “itemisation can make guidance more digestible, but can also make it harder to get the bigger picture” and makes text appear longer.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="var-ifs.easy-understand"><strong>?var:IFs.easy-understand</strong></h4>
<p>“Make guidance easier to understand” was written as a solution to help authors who misinterpret, or can’t understand, guidance. Participants suggested developers could “make guidance as ‘plain language’ as possible” os “create plain language versions of existing guidance”, whilst being “mindful of language that may appear patronizing”.</p>
<p>Participants suggested defining “key words or phrases in a glossary or tooltips”, using consistent terms across related resources, translating guidelines and examples, and ensuring these translations are easy to find by making them “searchable”, “linked properly” to each other, and “more evident on [the] EQUATOR site”.</p>
<p>Participants recognised a need to collect and respond to feedback from “international researchers” representative of the user base across disciplines and institutions, and that this could be sought when developing guidance to “test” it, but also on an ongoing basis to “continually revisit the items in the guidelines that may be confusing or difficult to implement”. As an example, one guideline developer contributed that collecting feedback had lead them to remove “the word ‘context’ because users struggled to understand it”.</p>

<section id="var-ifs.persuade" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="var-ifs.persuade"><strong>?var:IFs.persuade</strong></h4>
<p>When discussing how authors feel about reporting guidelines and checklists, participants reflected on how the wording and presentation of resources can influence authors’ perceptions of it.</p>
<p>Participants noted that a poorly formatted checklist, lacking “visual appeal/graphic design”, can “appear outdated” or “larger than it is”. Participants suggested that developers could use design to “foster feelings of simplicity”, and “engage graphic designers” if necessary.</p>
<p>Participants suggested rewording text and tone of voice to make reporting guidelines and checklists “appear less like ‘red tape’”, and to reassure authors that “reporting guidelines are just that: guidelines!”. Participants suggested adding this framing at the top of checklists “in case people don’t read the whole [guideline] paper”.</p>
<p>Reassurance seemed especially important when considering how to motivate authors to transparently report items that aren’t perfect, and that developers could use language and tone of voice to “foster a feeling of confidence, not judgement”, perhaps reminding “researchers that all research has limitations”. Reassurance could also be given by including notes aimed at reviewers, and participants cited JARS as an example “which explains to reviewers why an author may make certain choices”, thereby educating reviewers whilst reassuring authors that they won’t be penalised for transparency.</p>

<section id="var-ifs.create-tools" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="var-ifs.create-tools"><strong>?var:IFs.create-tools</strong></h4>
<p>Guidance is commonly detailed in a guideline or <em>example or elaboration</em> article. Developers can also make tools that make guidance easier to apply. The best known example of a tool are checklists which serve as a summary of the guidance and a way of demonstrating compliance to editors. Participants noted that checklists may be easier to use if they are editable (see <a href="@sec-?var:IFSecs.ready-to-use"><strong>?var:IFs.ready-to-use</strong></a>), and if authors could complete them with “the relevant text, rather than [the] page/section number” which can be frustrating to keep updated. (Although one participant, a publisher, noted that checklists completed with text are difficult to double check, and therefore it would be most useful to include the text <em>and</em> the page number).</p>
<p>To aid writing, participants suggested “templates for drafting” manuscripts, interactive forms and “writing tools (e.g., COBWEB)”, “tools for creating figures and tables like PRISMA’s flowchart generator”, and tools for generating text, like TIDIER’s tool for generating intervention description (<a href="http://www.tidierguide.org/#/author-tool">#REF</a>). However, one participant warned that these kinds of structured writing “provide opportunities for inclusion [of reporting items] but there is always the risk that they exclude more [important items] that are outside the boundaries of the template”.</p>
<p>To encourage authors to consider reporting guidance earlier in their research, participants considered to-do lists with items “in the order they are done”, or “embed[ing] items into data collection tools” like software for systematic reviewers.</p>
<p>To help reviewers check reporting, participants suggested creating “tools for co-researchers to check each others’ work”, creating extra guidance for peer reviewers, providing text that can be pasted in reviewer feedback forms to “request additional information” for poorly reported items, or even building a “reviewer tool that generates a report”.</p>
<p>Participants noted that tools should presented in ways that “better differentiate” how and when they should be used “e.g., resources for writing vs.&nbsp;checking vs.&nbsp;reviewing”.</p>

<section id="var-ifs.findable-resources" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="var-ifs.findable-resources"><strong>?var:IFs.findable-resources</strong></h4>
<p>Participants had ideas for how to help authors discover and find resources.</p>
<p>Participants wrote about links being an important way for authors to discover related guidelines and tools. These could be “horizontal links between related guidelines” and between guideline “documents and tools” like checklists and templates. All resources should “link to one another”, ideally “item by item” so that checklist items could link directly to the relevant section of full guidance. Participants noted that hyperlinks can become out of date, and so stakeholders should “fix broken links”.</p>
<p>Participants also wrote that resources could be hosted on “a convenient place, such as a unified website”. EQUATOR’s website is one such place, and participants suggested making it “easier to navigate” and its “search tool more prominent and easier to use”. One participant wrote that if a guideline’s “scope is clearly defined that will help search tools” <!-- consider removing to Discussion-->and that when related guidelines have similar names they can benefit from search spillovers. For instance, PRISMA-P may be more likely to appear in a Google search for PRISMA than SPRIT is to appear in a search for CONSORT, simply because of the name similarity. <!-- to here --></p>
<p>Although some authors will use such search tools, participants recognised that those who browse may benefit from “curated” collections of reporting guidelines by study type to create a “manageable list of related, commonly used guidelines”. As an example, an author writing a review article may be helped by a page listing “PRISMA, MOOSE, ENTREQ, PRISMA-SRc etc.” and that “this page could be kept up to date as guidelines are revised”. Another participant (a publisher) warned, however, that journals may not want to link to these pages if the collection has “a much broader scope” and includes guidelines that the journal doesn’t endorse.</p>
<p>Finding the right guidance is difficult for authors who are less familiar with study designs. One participants suggested creating “tools to help researchers identify study designs (e.g., a questionnaire)”, and another, already familiar with such a tool previously developed by EQUATOR suggested it should “use plain language”.</p>

<section id="var-ifs.information-architecture" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="var-ifs.information-architecture"><strong>?var:IFs.information-architecture</strong></h4>
<p>Participants acknowledged that authors may use guidance in different ways; some will read the whole thing from start to finish, whilst others will dip in and out as-and-when they need. Similarly, different users will have different needs depending on their task (drafting, checking, reviewing) or stage of research (planning or writing up). Consequently, participants wrote that “having different options available that meet the needs of different users is vital” and that users should be able to consult guidance in ways that “work for them”.</p>
<p>One suggested way of doing this may be to “structure guidance using navigation menus and subheadings” so that “it is easy to find the information you need”, making reporting guidelines faster to use and less overwhelming. Another noted that checklists can also be designed, citing TIDIER as “a nice example. They have integrated the intervention and placebo into one table” with the active intervention and placebo in adjacent columns.</p>
<p>Dynamically hiding and showing content was floated here again (see <a href="@sec-?var:IFSecs.keep-short"><strong>?var:IFs.keep-short</strong></a>), with one participant suggesting that users could “filter out” irrelevant content, to only see instructions for their task (e.g.&nbsp;planning, writing, reviewing) or specific to their study. This could be done with a “decision tree” or “branching questions” to determine specific features of the study (“e.g., a systematic review <em>with</em> network meta-analysis <em>of</em> individual participant data”). Answers to these questions could then be used to to “modify” items to create “personalised guidelines”, or to generate a “customised reporting checklist” that includes all “main and relevant extension items”.</p>
<p>Dynamic content was also seen as a favourable way to embed guideline extensions, with the aim of making them easier to discover without overwhelming the author. For example, noting that “some guidelines ‘fit together’…e.g., PRISMA and PRISMA-Abstracts”, participants wrote that PRISMA-Abstracts could be “embedded”, perhaps as collapsed content that interested authors could expand.</p>

<p>When introducing reporting guidelines participants suggested telling authors what reporting guidelines are, “when and how best to use” them, and what benefits to expect. This information could go wherever authors are advised to use reporting guidelines (like like journal instruction pages, registries), EQUATOR’s website, social media campaigns, at the start of the guidelines, and could go at the beginning of checklists too “in case people don’t read the whole [guideline] paper”. This introductory text could be “short, sweet, and to the point”. Benefits could be even more prominent by putting them “in a box, or [by using] font or positioning”.</p>
<!-- #TODO: The quote above about in case people don't read the full guidance was included elsewhere -->
<p>Noting that it might not be obvious how or when to use guidance, participants suggested being explicit about this. For example, “tell authors that they don’t need to fill out templates [or checklists] sequentially but can use an order that matches their workflow or decision making. Put this instruction on the template, checklists, and other tools. Example from PRISMA – population and subgroup items are separated in the checklist but go together when thinking/making decisions.”. Similarly, authors could benefit from explicit suggestions of how to use reporting guidelines as a team, perhaps by asking “their co-researchers to check their reporting”.</p>
<!-- #TODO: check that personal benefits are included elsewhere. E.g., Researchers report caring more about personal, immediate benefits compared to hypothetical benefits to others; More transparent reporting / structured reporting may lead to faster editorial processes as it becomes easy for peer reviewers and editors to review papers about their study, Provide statistics about processing times of articles that follow / don’t follow reporting standards.

Participants proposed that testimonials could bring benefits to life, thereby making them more believable.</p>
<p>To make authors care more about research waste caused by poor reporting, participants suggested testimonials from “research consumers for whom an item is important”, or quotes that illustrate “how detrimental poor reporting is for end users”.</p>
<p>Participants wrote that testimonials from decision makers (like editors, reviewers, and grant-givers) could communicate their “preference for transparent reporting” and convince authors that reporting will be checked.

Participants also suggested collecting testimonials from such “nervous researchers”.</p>
<p>Finally, participants suggested collecting testimonials from researchers “with a range of experience”, including “experienced researchers who have benefited by changing their practices”.

<section id="var-ifs.create-spaces" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="var-ifs.create-spaces"><strong>?var:IFs.create-spaces</strong></h4>
<p>Multiple barriers lead participants suggesting to “create spaces for researchers to connect with other researchers to celebrate and share experiences”. These spaces could include “forums, meetings, tea clubs, [and] clinics both in real life and virtual”.</p>
<p>Such spaces could help authors solicit help and could act as social proof, as seeing “others using and talking about the guidance” may be motivational.</p>
<p>Online discussion spaces were also considered a useful way to gather feedback from users directly (by asking for it) and indirectly (by monitoring discussions). Providing feedback channels “could be useful to guideline developers”, and may also “cultivate a feeling of community ownership” by “communicating an invitational attitude”, thereby making guidelines appear less like red tape imposed by a faceless bureaucracy.</p>

"How can we enable users to give feedback on guidance?
Researchers have opinions on how the guidance could be improved including how to make it clearer, and whether items should be rearranged, separated, combined, added or removed. 
This information could be useful to guideline developers"

<section id="var-ifs.early-acquisition" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="var-ifs.early-acquisition"><strong>?var:IFs.early-acquisition</strong></h4>
<p>Participants thought of ways to “try and shift the time at which researchers discover or use guidelines”, hypothesising that “it’s more likely that guidelines will save them time” if used earlier or “at the right time” and “not just upon submission”.</p>
<p>Most simply, participants suggested “telling” or “encouraging” authors visiting the EQUATOR Network website to use reporting guidelines for planning or drafting research (and not just for demonstrating compliance upon submission). Building upon this, participants suggested organising the website to make it obvious which stages of work resources can be used for.</p>
<p>Participants suggested “including [reporting guidelines] in the university teaching and training curriculum and text books” so that students learn about them before running or writing up their first study.</p>
<p>Participants suggested creating reporting guidance for early research outputs like funding applications and protocols (see <a href="@sec-?var:IFSecs.create-early-guidance"><strong>?var:IFs.create-early-guidance</strong></a>), and advertising resources through funders, ethics committees, and writing training programmes.</p>
<p>When considering whether authors may need reminders to use a reporting guideline for their next study, participants suggested publishers and EQUATOR could use “email reminders” or strategies used by e-commerce sites “like when you buy something from an online business…then they work hard to gain your custom again” via automated campaigns.</p>

<section id="var-ifs.endorse-enforce" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="var-ifs.endorse-enforce"><strong>?var:IFs.endorse-enforce</strong></h4>
<p>Participants suggested “encouraging more journals to endorse guidelines” and drew a distinction between endorsing reporting guidelines and promoting them on a website, social media, or email (see <a href="@sec-"><strong>?var:IFs.promote</strong></a>). Endorsement was described as a long term commitment to recommend or encourage guideline use, requiring buy-in from organisational leaders, and possibly changes to policies, instructions, infrastructure, and workflows. Promotion, conversely, could be ephemeral and does not require organisational changes.</p>
<p>Another distinction was drawn between endorsement and enforcement, whereby reporting guidelines are “a requirement” or “condition”. Enforcement was further divided into enforcing checklist completion or, noting that checklists may not always accurately reflect manuscript content, checking text for adherence to guidance.</p>
<p>When considering <em>who</em> could enforce guidelines, participants noted that reporting guidelines could be “a requirement for publication”, “for registration (where applicable) (e.g.&nbsp;clinical trial registries, PROSPERO)”, or when submitting conference abstracts. “Ethics committees and funding organisations” could require that adhere to guidelines, “for example, completion of SPIRIT for clinical trial submissions”, or to declare that they will use a guideline when writing their results. Participants suggested that the software academics use to provide funders with updates could ask for completed checklists. One participant suggested that reporting guideline adherence should be a condition of university employment.</p>
<p>Noting that enforcement requires resources, participants suggested to “focus on main RGs and being compliant with them” or to create “digital dashboard to help audit and monitoring”.</p>

<section id="var-ifs.evidence-benefits" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="var-ifs.evidence-benefits"><strong>?var:IFs.evidence-benefits</strong></h4>
<p>Participants suggested that benefits may be more believable if there were evidenced. Most fundamentally, this could be “evidence that [reporting guidelines] improve the completeness and transparency of the output”. For quantifiable benefits, the suggestion was to collect and report data on “acceptance rates, publishing speed, writing speed”. One participant posited that “more transparent reporting / structured reporting may lead to faster editorial processes as it becomes easy for peer reviewers and editors to review papers about their study” and another suggested to “provide statistics about processing times of articles that follow / don’t follow reporting standards. Emphasise to researchers that clear reporting will minimise the number of times others contact them for clarification”.</p>
<p>However, some participants were sceptical whether data on acceptance rates would show any benefit at all: “Likelihood of being accepted might not be heavily influenced – bad research well reported would still be rejected”.</p>
<p>For experiential benefits that cannot be quantified, participants suggested providing case studies or testimonials (see <a href="@sec-?var:IFSecs.testimonials"><strong>?var:IFs.testimonials</strong></a>).</p>

<section id="var-ifs.apparent-priority" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="var-ifs.apparent-priority"><strong>?var:IFs.apparent-priority</strong></h4>
<p>When a journal endorses or enforces reporting guidelines, participants suggested making reporting guidelines more prominent within the journal’s workflow to make them appear more important. Notes included that “reporting guidelines could be more prominent on journal author guideline pages”, or that “if the journal uses any sort of structured peer review (e.g., specific questions related to methodology) to tell authors this explicitly [on author guideline pages and within review feedback] and link it to the reporting guideline content”. A third suggestion was that “when journals ‘stitch’ or ‘build’ together the manuscript pdf (including cover letter, manuscript main text, appendices, etc.), prioritise the reporting guideline or move it earlier in the pdf”.</p>
<p>However, a few participants (publishers) warned that prioritising guidelines on author instruction pages “is complicated as these [pages] already have to do a lot”, although guidelines could be more prominent if the pages “were better organised and/or filterable”.</p>

<section id="var-ifs.promote" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="var-ifs.promote"><strong>?var:IFs.promote</strong></h4>
<p>Participants wrote that all stakeholders could help spread the word that reporting guidelines exist. Promotion was considered different to endorsement, as it doesn’t require the promoting party to have a policy in place or any other role in research production. For example, “professional societies” could “advertise” reporting guidelines, despite not having a role in the funding, regulation or dissemination of research.</p>
<p>Promotion could occur online. Most obviously, on stakeholder guidance web pages. “Email campaigns, social media, blogs” could be useful channels to “share and connect with others [and] drive traffic to guideline website[s]”, but “these require time and energy” from the reporting guideline community to set up and manage.</p>
<p>“Conferences and workshops at institutions” were cited as channels to promote reporting guideline offline, as were ” seminars, webinars, and presentations” especially in “hard to reach countries/fields”. These events were described as useful ways “to assist in the interpretation and use of the guidelines” and could be opportunities for “universities/funders/journals [to speak] together about the importance of reporting guidelines”.</p>
<p>To reach students, participants suggested that universities could include reporting guidelines in their curricula, learning materials, or through reporting champions (see <a href="@sec-?var:IFSecs.reporting-champions"><strong>?var:IFs.reporting-champions</strong></a>).</p>
<p>Participants wrote that “promotion can begin before a guideline has been published so that researchers know about guidelines being developed” and suggested “the provision of a time buffer/phasing period for updating new reporting guidelines which would allow researchers to have information about these new guidelines”.</p>

<section id="var-ifs.reporting-champions" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="var-ifs.reporting-champions"><strong>?var:IFs.reporting-champions</strong></h4>
<p>Participants suggested that all stakeholders could have members to promote and facilitate the usage of reporting guidelines, centring on the terms “champions” and “EQUATOR ambassadors”. Within publishers, funders, or ethics board, a champion’s responsibility may be to “expand knowledge/awareness of guidelines”. Within institutions, champions could also “help researchers” by “providing feedback on writing” and that ECRs may feel most comfortable talking with a champion from “an accessible level (e.g., post-doc, library staff)”. This could follow a local network model (UKRN was cited as an example) with EQUATOR as the central organiser, and could utilize existing reproducibility networks.</p>

<section id="var-ifs.support" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="var-ifs.support"><strong>?var:IFs.support</strong></h4>
<p>Participants proposed additional teaching as a way to promote reporting guidelines, make them easier to use, and a way to communicate the impacts of poor reporting. Education and training could be general (EQUATOR’s publication school was cited as an example) of could be “guideline-specific”, and could be delivered in person or online, as courses, videos, or text.</p>
<p>In addition to learning about a particular guideline, students could learn about “writing as a process” and “workflows for documenting and communicating research”. This was seen as useful as “researchers don’t necessarily understand that reporting is a stage in the research process”. Curricula could include “methods studies that indicate the research waste” to teach students why reporting matters, or students could learn for themselves by attempting “to replicate a study or do a systematic review to discover how poorly research is currently reported”.</p>
<p>To gain experience in using reporting guidelines, participants suggested students could develop “research protocols (as Bachelor or Master Theses) using reporting guidelines” and that these could “be assessed based on the compliance with the appropriate reporting guideline” in addition to “other criteria more related with methodology”. To make this easier, participants suggested structuring courses around reporting guideline items “for example: a course on [randomized controlled trials] covering every single SPIRIT or CONSORT item”.</p>

<section id="var-ifs.updating" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="var-ifs.updating"><strong>?var:IFs.updating</strong></h4>
<p>Participants acknowledged that “researchers have opinions on how the guidance could be improved including how to make it clearer, and whether items should be rearranged, separated, combined, added or removed” and that “this information could be useful to guideline developers”. Some participants went further, expressing that guidance and websites should be updated “in response to user feedback or changes in the field”. This idea differs from the others in that it focusses on the behaviour of reporting guideline <em>developers</em>, not users, but I include it as it is a natural extension of many other ideas.</p>
<p>One developer wrote “how can we enable users to give feedback on guidance?”, whilst another wrote “provide ways for researchers to give feedback to guideline developers” without forwarding any ways to do this. Others suggested that “developers could consult different user groups when creating guidance” and “engage as many health professions as possible” so that “professional cultural issues can be usefully accommodated.”</p>
<p>Once feedback has been collected, one developer suggested that “minor updates could be made without publishing a new article” if the guidance were disseminated on a website. Many guideline developers noted that they required access to extra funding to evaluate, refine, and update their resources.</p>
