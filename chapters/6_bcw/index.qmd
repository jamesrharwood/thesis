<!-- Introduce MRC guidance more. Explain how I have tried to align with values. 

Admit I did not know about PBA. Explain what it is. Explain how my approach overlaps with it, and sign post to discussion. -->

In my introductory chapter I presented how I view reporting guidelines to be part of a complex behaviour change intervention. But I have not always viewed them this way. On beginning my PhD, I would have described reporting guidelines as standards for authors to adhere to. I would have stopped there, my thoughts going no deeper. I did not think about how guidance was communicated, whether through publications, example & elaboration documents, or checklists, and the differences between those resources. I did not think about the websites authors used to find those resources. I did not think about _how_ or _when_ authors used guidance. 

But after reading accounts of authors struggling with the guidance content, access, formats, workflows, confidence, and the behaviour of others, I began to think of guidelines as more than mere text. Instead of revering guidelines as perfect publications set in stone, I began to see them as resources whose content, structure,and layout could be optimized. Beyond these resources I began to see the broader system that creates and disseminates them. I began to recognise the complexity arising from the number of different stakeholders involved, differences between guidelines, the skills and prior knowledge an author must have to act on the guidance, and variation in _how_, _when_, and _why_ guidelines are used. 

I looked for a framework to help me understand and improve this complex system. I considered the MRC guidance for developing and evaluating complex interventions[@skivingtonNewFrameworkDeveloping2021] and the Person Based Approach (PBA)[@yardleyPersonBasedApproachIntervention2015]. Both emphasise the importance of understanding context, evidencing needs, and iterative evaluation and refinement. Both recommend involving stakeholders and the intervention recipients. I have adhered to these principles in my thesis. In chapters {{< var chapters.synthesis >}} - {{< var chapters.web-audit >}} I collected evidence for needs and context. In chapters {{< var chapters.workshops >}}, {{< var chapters.focus-groups >}}, and {{< var chapters.pilot >}} I explain how I involved stakeholders and users, and in chapters {{< var chapters.pilot >}} and {{< var chapters.discussion >}} I explain how I refined the intervention in response to author feedback and possible next steps for iterative development. 

However, at this stage in my PhD my aim was to find solutions to the barriers I had identified. Neither MRC guidelines nor PBA advise you how to do this directly. Instead, they encourage intervention designers to theorise how the intervention is working. To do this, designers need to select a theoretical framework. First I considered the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF, @caneValidationTheoreticalDomains2012; @michieMakingPsychologicalTheory2005). The TDF was developed to help implementation researchers identify what influences the behaviour of health professionals and patients. It was made by synthesising 33 theories of behaviour and behaviour change into 14 domains that cover the cognitive, affective, social, and environmental influences on behaviour. The TDF and its accompanying guide @atkinsGuideUsingTheoretical2017 are useful, but they require considerable understanding of psychological constructs that might not be familiar to non-behavioural experts, and although the TDF helps understand what influences behaviour, there is little guidance on how to then go about _changing_ behaviour.

The Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW, @michieBehaviourChangeWheel2011) addresses these limitations. It is designed for "policy makers, intervention designers, researchers and practitioners…from a wide range of disciplines with varying levels of expertise". It was made by synthesizing 19 existing frameworks. In doing so, Michie et al. ensured the BCW is comprehensive (it covers all intervention options), conceptually coherent (category members are of same type), and linked to an overarching model of behaviour. This was one of their core objectives, as prevailing frameworks at the time lacked these qualities. For example, they criticise MINDSPACE @dolanMINDSPACEInfluencingBehaviour2010 (popular amongst UK policy makers at the time) for not including all intervention types and for conflating psychological constructs with mechanisms of action and modes or delivery.

The BCW's core is the COM-B model of behaviour, which stands for Capability, Opportunity, Motivation and Behaviour and is simpler and more intuitive than the TDF. When making COM-B, Michie et al began with motivation, defined as: "brain processes that energize and direct behaviour" @mookMotivationOrganizationAction. Their next step was "to consider the minimum number of additional factors needed to account for whether change in the behavioural target would occur, given sufficient motivation" @michieBehaviourChangeWheel2011. They used a US consensus meeting of behavioural theorists @fishbeinFactorsInfluencingBehavior2001 and a centuries-old principle of criminal law: that to prove guilt one must show means or capability, opportunity, and motive. Michie et al. argued that the "common conclusion from these two separate strands of thought lends confidence to this model of behaviour"@michieBehaviourChangeWheel2011, and they added further confidence by mapping COM-B to the TDF. When describing COM-B, Michie et al. explain how the components capability, opportunity, and motivation interact with each other to generate behaviour which, in turn, may influence these components. (See @fig-com-b)

The COM-B model holds that behaviour arises from a system that involves three components: Capability, Opportunity, and Motivation. These are defined in @tbl-com-b but, briefly; capability includes having the required knowledge; opportunity includes the necessary resources such as time, materials, or reminders; and motivation means having the required intentions, beliefs, wants and needs to perform the behaviour.

The innermost ring is the COM-B model for understanding behaviour, the middle ring are intervention functions, and the outer ring are policy categories.

Changing behaviour requires altering one or more of these components and the BCW goes beyond the TDF by helping intervention designers select options to achieve this. The wheel's middle ring contains intervention functions, defined as "broad categories of means by which an intervention can change behaviour" @michieBehaviourChangeWheel2014. An intervention may have multiple functions. For example, a television advert about drink driving may educate its audience with information about alcohol limits and persuade using emotive imagery. In this example, education is being used as an intervention function to target psychological capability (teaching people how much they can safely drink before driving) and persuasion is being used to target motivation (targeting people’s emotions to make them less likely to want to engage in drink driving). The functions you choose depend on the behavioural drivers you are trying to target. Intervention functions are described in @tbl-intervention-functions.

Having decided what functions your intervention needs, the guide helps you decide how to implement them with policy categories, defined as "types of decisions made by authorities that help to support and enact the interventions" @michieBehaviourChangeWheel2014. Categories include communication/marketing, guidelines, regulation, and service provision, as described in @tbl-policy-categories. 

Recognizing that intervention designers come from various disciplines and places of work, and that not all will have experience in applying behaviour change theory, Michie et al. published a book to help designers apply the BCW @michieBehaviourChangeWheel2014. This book contains suggested steps, exercises, and worksheets. In the next chapter, I describe how I guided members of the UK EQUATOR Centre through this process.

<!-- #TODO: consider moving this paragraph to the design chapter? Initially, and probably because of my background in software development, I looked at user experience literature (e.g., @experienceGuideUsingUserExperience) but quickly realised that heuristics for creating easy-to-use websites don't really generalise to long-form instructional text. Thinking of comparable documents, I then looked into user testing instruction manuals (@mollerUsabilityTestingUser2013) but found that focusing on the document alone neglected other parts of the intervention, like the impact of journal policies or the behaviour of peer reviewers. A conversation with a professor of Human-Computer Interaction was interesting but focussing on information technology design seemed, again, to only cover part of the problem. -->
