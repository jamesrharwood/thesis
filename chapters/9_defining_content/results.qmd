## Results

### Intervention components 

From the initial list of {{< var counts.sub_ideas >}} ideas I identified {{< var counts.redesign.intervention-components.unique >}} intervention components that could be implemented by redesigning guidelines and by improving the EQUATOR Network home page. Together, these components use {{< var counts.redesign.bcts-used >}} behaviour change techniques and {{< var counts.redesign.intervention-functions-used >}} intervention functions to target {{< var counts.redesign.barriers-targeted >}} influences. Of these {{< var counts.redesign.intervention-components.unique >}} intervention components I managed to include {{< var counts.redesign.intervention-components.included_unique >}} when redesigning SRQR and EQUATOR's home page. The remainder were not feasible. 

The full intervention component table is long and disrupted the narrative of this chapter, and so I moved it to Appendix {{< var appendix.ict >}}. In this chapter I've included shorter tables for each intervention part, and summarised included components labelled with their intervention function and employed behaviour change technique. I'll now go through parts of the design and summarize the components in each.

### Intervention description

#### Site organisation and search

Some intervention components required considering how authors would navigate and search the website (see @tbl-ics-organisation). My first meeting with the design advisory group focussed on how the redesigned home page and guideline should link, and whether we needed any steps in between the two. On EQUATOR's existing website, authors starting on the home page must navigate through 5 webpages to reach the full reporting guidance; the home page, guideline database page, PubMed, a publication, and then sometimes a supplement. From my website service evaluation (chapter {{< var chapters.web-audit >}}), we knew many authors leave at each step (see @fig-sankey-b4). Therefore, we wanted our redesigned home page to link directly to the most frequently used guidelines, thereby reducing this this journey to 2 steps, with the aim to increase the proportion of authors reaching the full guidance (see @fig-sankey-after).

<!-- Journey before -->

The proportion of users navigating between each step is shown in the width of the links. Links in grey are estimated proportions. "Exit" means leaving the website.

<!-- #STRETCH remake this figure without changing the exit rate -->

We also decided to display the full guidance texts on the website whenever licences allow. Currently, EQUATOR's website directs authors to different publishers and guideline development group websites. Sometimes the full guidance is published as a supplementary material, and checklists can appear as supplements, tables, or figures. Bringing the full guidance texts to a single website makes them easier to find, means we can ensure all have a consistent, usable format, and allows us to track authors behaviour. But this is only possible when guidance is published under a permissible licence. 

When discussing how authors would navigate the website, we decided to cater to both users that search and users that browse. The website features a search function adhering to user experience norms (the search button on EQUATOR's original website is difficult to find), and each web page has enhanced meta data to optimise search engine performance. To help browsing authors, we decided to ensure all related guidelines and resources link to each other. Previously, guidelines rarely linked to each other, and checklists rarely linked to full guidance. In the redesign, guidelines link to related guidelines, and all resources link to each other. In the future, EQUATOR may consider creating collections of related guidelines (e.g., a page featuring all guidelines relating to a study design, health condition, or theme), decision aid tools, or may embed related guidelines (e.g., PRISMA for Abstracts could be embedded within PRISMA).

#### Intervention components that occur throughout

Some intervention components pervaded all parts of the redesign (see @tbl-ics-throughout). These components centred on three themes: our target audience, nudging authors towards using guidelines earlier in their writing, and positioning reporting guidelines as helpful rather than administrative.

In the methods section I described how EQUATOR and I decided that our primary audience was authors (not editors, reviewers etc.), and _inexperienced_ authors in particular. In my thematic synthesis (chapter {{< var chapters.synthesis >}}) I found some authors felt reporting checklists were the responsibility of an editor or peer reviewer. In part, this might be because some reporting guidelines are written passively ("Reports should describe..." etc.). In contrast, my design speaks directly to the author ("When writing up _your_ research..." etc.), and I used terminology with inexperienced authors in mind. 

Many components nudge authors towards using reporting guidelines early in their writing. For instance, the first text authors see mentions "writing up" and the guideline text is worded from the perspective of writing (as opposed to checking or reviewing). The home page and guideline page explicitly describe stages of writing where reporting guidelines can be used. The website layout forces authors to access the full guidance before the checklist, and the checklist button is positioned after the button for a template that can be used when drafting. The meta-data for search engines includes terms like "how to write" or "describe" so the pages appears in search engine results when authors search queries like 'how to write up an epidemiology study'. In contrast, my thematic synthesis revealed that some authors may currently think reporting guidelines _are_ checklists, and are meant to be used as part of journal submission. This is, after all, how most authors discover them and few guidelines contain any instruction to the contrary. 

Finally, because my thematic synthesis found some authors describe reporting guidelines as administrative red-tape, I wanted to position reporting guidelines as trusted resources that will help, not hinder, researchers. I did this by creating content and an aesthetic that would foster trust and convey two personal benefits of using reporting guidelines: simplicity and confidence. I created this aesthetic by using a simple colour scheme with plenty of negative space. I tried to keep the tone of voice professional but simple and empowering. I avoided design or language that may invoke feelings of judgement, complexity, or administration. I tried to keep language concise and clear without being patronizing.

#### Home page

EQUATOR's current home page (see @fig-home-b4) does not define what reporting guidelines are, or how or why to use them. Although it is full of content, the overall impression is one of complexity with no clear message. Intervention components appearing on the home page are listed in @tbl-ics-home. Its limitations include:

1) No prominent description of what reporting guidelines are
2) No clear instruction on what tasks reporting guidelines can and cannot be used for 
3) Search function hard to find (area A) 
4) Decision tool for identifying which reporting guideline to use was hard to find (area B) 
5) The page looked cluttered and unappealing 
6) The tone of voice was functional. It was not particularly judgemental but not reassuring either. 
7) There was little description of benefits of using a reporting guideline besides the mention of 'quality' and 'transparency' in the definition of EQUATOR, reference to 'high-impact research', 'improve your writing', and 'enhance your peer review' in the header. 
8) No reassurance that most research has limitations 
9) Frequently accessed guidelines are fairly easy to find (area C).

In contract, the redesigned homepage aims to minimise the proportion of authors leaving the website without engaging with reporting guidelines. The home page explains what reporting guidelines are, what writing tasks to use them for, the personal benefits they offer, and why reporting is important for reproducibility. Short quotes from authors and editors, expounding the benefits of using reporting guidelines aim to convince sceptical authors. The redesigned home page can bee seen in @fig-home. Intervention changes made to the homepage include:  

1) Reporting guidelines are now clearly defined (areas A) 
2) The site looks simple and has plenty of white space
3) Personal benefits are described explicitly and communicated through reassuring language and quotes (see areas B)
4) Search and browse buttons are easy to find (area C) 
5) Frequently accessed guidelines are still easy to find (area D) 
6) The site describes what tasks reporting guidelines can be used for, and differentiates tools by task (area E)

#### Introduction to the SRQR reporting guideline

Although some journals direct authors to EQUATOR's home page,  others send authors straight to EQUATOR's database records for a particular reporting guidelines. Although EQUATOR's database pages for each guideline do include some explanation of when the guideline should be used, and links to related guidelines and tools, this information was quite hard to find and the pages lacked many other intervention components (see @fig-db-b4). Limitations of the existing database pages include:

1) The actual guidance is hard to find. Area A includes 3 links. The first two send users to an article describing how SRQR was developed. The actual guidance appears in a supplement of that article, which is the third link in area A. The label "relevant URLs" is vague. 
2) Little instruction regarding what the reporting guideline is or can be used for other than "Qualitative research" 
3) Links to related guidelines that are hard to find or, as for SRQR, absent 
4) No metrics around how many authors use this reporting guideline (e.g., citation counts) 
5) The French translation of the guidance is well labelled and fairly easy to find (area B), but to the right of it is a box prominently labelled "Translations", and the link in here would actually take the user further away from the translated guidance.

<!-- ## FIG-DB-B4 -->
![The existing EQUATOR page for SRQR, as captured on 5th April, 2023. Labelled limitations are described in the previous paragraph.](figures/db_page_b4.png){#fig-db-b4 height=200mm}

EQUATOR's database pages direct authors to reporting guideline publications. Although these publications might include (or link to) the full guidance, most focus on lengthy descriptions of how the guidance was made and justifications of why it is needed. This is true for SRQR (see @fig-rg-intro-b4). Limitations of these publications may include:

1) Not all reporting guidelines describe what reporting guidelines are or what they can be used for, and these descriptions can be hard to find (areas A). 
2) The actual guidance or checklist may be relegated to a box, table (area B), or a linked supplement (see area C) . 
3) Reporting guideline publications may not reassure authors that most research has limitations, and that transparency is OK 
4) Publications may not be written with a reassuring tone of voice. Guideline developers often justify reporting items by emphasising the negative impact of research waste. This may be how developers justify their work to themselves, editors, reviewers, or readers. As a result, to a naïve author considering using the guidance, the tone of voice may come across as judgemental. 
5) Benefits to the user may be hard to find or (as with SRQR) not described at all. Benefits to _others_ are more likely to be described, including a focus on how transparent, complete reporting benefits the research community or, conversely, how poor reporting is wasteful. 
6) Instruction on when reporting guidelines do/do not intend to prescribe structure, or instruction may be hard to find (see area D) or missing. 
7) Instructions on whether a reporting guideline intends to be a strict standard vs. 'just' a guideline may be hard to find (see area D) or missing. 
8) Links to related resources only include those that were created before the reporting guideline was published. Some guidelines don't include any links.
9) No clear instruction on whether to use the guideline in a situation that it wasn't designed for, but when no better guidance exists.

<!-- ## FIG-reporting guideline-INTRO-B4 -->
![The SRQR publication, captured on the 5th April, 2023. Areas A-D show the scope, checklist, link to the guidance, and its strictness.](figures/rg-intro-b4.png){#fig-rg-intro-b4 height=200mm}

In my redesign, I wanted authors to be able to find the full guidance directly, without having to navigate a database page or lengthy development article. However, I still wanted to include an introduction and FAQ section to help authors quickly understand what the guideline is, what it _isn't_, whether it applies to them and, if it does, to convince them to use it (see @tbl-ics-rg-intro). Because half of visitors bypass the home page and arrive directly on these guideline-specific pages, I decided to duplicate some home page components aimed at naïve authors such as basic information on what reporting guidelines, how to use them, when to use them, and why. Intervention changes included in reporting guidelines' introductions and FAQs (shown in @fig-rg-intro) include:

1) Clear description of what the reporting guideline is, what it can and cannot be used for, the benefits to the author and to society, and how and when it can be used. (area A) 
2) Description of whether the reporting guideline is intended to be a standard or 'just' a guideline (area A) 
3) Tools are clearly differentiated by task (area B) 
4) Related guidelines and other resources are linked. These links can be updated as and when newer guidelines are published (area C) 
5) Clear instruction on whether a reporting guideline can be used in a situation that it wasn't designed for, but where no better guidance exists (area D) 
6) Links to translations (area E) 
7) Reassuring language throughout, and reassuring quotes from editors, readers, and authors (e.g., area F) 
8) Citation metrics (area G) 
9) An estimation of how long guidance will take to read (area H) 
10) Advice on how or where to report items so as not to breach word count limits and when reporting guidelines do or do not intend to prescribe structure (area I) 
11) Citation information (area K) 
12) Information on how the guidance was developed and why it can be trusted (area L)

#### Reporting guideline content

Reporting guidelines comprise reporting _items_, and an example from SRQR is in @fig-item-b4. Limitations of how items are typically described include:

1) Text is unstructured, so it is difficult to immediately identify what needs to be written.
2) Text uses verbose, passive language
3) The text appears long and difficult to digest
4) Terms are not always defined
5) Not all reporting items are justified
6) Not all items include instruction of what to write if the item could not/was not done.

![An example item from the SRQR guideline.](figures/item-b4.png){#fig-item-b4 height=150mm}

When redesigning items, although I did not change the meaning of guidance, I did give additional structure and edit phrasing. To increase clarity, I used plain language, consistent terms, and added definitions when I felt necessary. I wanted to cater to authors who read from start to finish as well as those who dip in and out, and so I created navigation menus so authors can jump to items. Intervention components applying to the entire reporting guideline content (which includes but is not limited to reporting items) appear in @tbl-ics-rg-content.
	
For each reporting item, I prioritized instructions of what to write. I placed remaining content in an expandable box, thus making the guidance appear shorter at first glance. Each expandable box includes why the reporting item is important and to whom, examples, links to related advice, and any other content that isn't an instruction of what to write. Each item links to its own discussion channel. Two intervention components required presenting design advice separately to reporting advice, but this was not necessary as SRQR made few design assumptions or recommendations. Intervention components applying to reporting items appear in @tbl-ics-item.

@fig-item shows a redesigned reporting item. Intervention changes include:

1) Content is separated into what to write (area A), why information is important (area B), examples (area C), and any additional background information (not shown). 
2) Areas B and C are presented as expandable content, so the only instruction immediately visible is what to write (area A). This means that the guidance is easier to digest and less intimidating.
3) Definitions are presented as pop-ups for technical terms
4) Quotes provide reassurance and persuasion (area D) 
5) Language is direct and edited for clarity and brevity 
6) Each item has its own discussion page (see @fig-discussion, linked to from the top right of area A)

#### FAQ

At the end of the guideline, an FAQ section includes information that was too lengthy to be fully discussed in the page's introduction (see @tbl-ics-faq). This includes a longer description of how the guideline's development (and link to the original publication), citation instruction, and advice on how to respond if an editor or co-worker asks you to remove guideline content.

### System architecture

EQUATOR's existing website is built using Wordpress. Although EQUATOR staff can make basic content modifications using a content managing system, they rely on software developers for more significant alterations. I considered Wordpress and other DIY website builders (like Wix @YourWebsiteYour or Squarespace @WebsiteBuilderCreate) but decided against them. Most come with expensive monthly subscriptions. Most offer a 'drag and drop' building experience which, although easy to use, is a laborious way of uploading and formatting large amounts of content. Should EQUATOR want to change how reporting items are presented (for example, reposition examples), they would have to manually edit every item for every reporting guideline. Additionally, many intended intervention changes required functionality not offered by these services (e.g., popup glossary definitions, discussion boards).

Creating a custom coded website also felt unacceptable. Html and javascript are two languages commonly used for creating websites. Although many software developers will be fluent in them, few early career researchers are, and fewer still would have the necessary experience to maintain databases or web servers. 

I noticed that researchers are increasingly writing reproducible manuscripts using markdown, and therein lay a compromise that promised the functionality we needed without technical expertise. Markdown is a simple language and takes minutes to learn. It uses asterisks, underscores, and carets to make text **\*\*bold\*\***, _\_italic\__, or ^\^superscript\^^. Headings, URLS, and references are similarly easy, and free editing software makes writing markdown feel like writing a Microsoft Word document. Markdown converts into lots of other formats, including docx (Microsoft Word files), LaTeX, PDF, and HTML. 

Many researchers already use tools like RStudio @RStudioIntegratedDevelopment or Quarto @QuartoOpenSource to convert markdown into other formats. I decided to use Quarto because it is open source, has great documentation, and its functionality can be extended with other programming languages commonly used by researchers and statisticians, like Python or Ruby. Quarto takes plain text (markdown) and converts it into a web page. Academics who write using Quarto or R Studio will be familiar with the idea of "knitting" documents together: taking text with data, figures, analyses, and references, all saved as separate files, and compiling them into a single, publication-ready manuscript. The process of creating a web page is similar. I've created a platform that takes a guideline, stored as plain text across multiple files, and converts it into an interactive web page. These guideline files include reporting items, a glossary, meta data, introductory information, and FAQ information. 

Quarto websites do not require a database or a server. This means they are free to host, easy to maintain, and have fewer data security concerns. Because all reporting guideline content is saved as plain text files, these files can be version controlled on Github, an industry-leading version control system commonly used by academics, and each version can be cited. This means guideline developers will be able to release incremental updates (e.g., to clarify the wording of a reporting item) and authors will be able to cite the exact version of the guidance they used. 

I've made all code available on Github @jamesharwoodEQUATORGuidelinesWebsite2023. I've used Github Pages @GitHubPages to host the website because it is free, secure, beginner friendly, configurable, and integrates seamlessly with Github's version control system.
