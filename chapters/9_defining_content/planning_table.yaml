# Intervention Planning Table
Engage with (read) appropriate reporting guidance as early as possible:
  what-are-rgs:
    ingredients:
      Describe what reporting guidelines are where they are first encountered:
        before: No prominent description of what reporting guidelines are on EQUATOR home page or in reporting guidelines resources. 
        before_example: See @fig-home-b4, @fig-rg-intro-b4, @fig-checklist-b4, @fig-journal-instructions 
        now: Prominent definition on home page and guideline page.
        now_example: See @fig-home, @fig-rg-intro
        future: Advise stakeholders on how to introduce reporting guidelines.^*^
        IF: Education
        BCT: Instruction on how to perform the behavior
        done: true
        evaluation_methods: 5 second test, interview
      Clarify what tasks (e.g., writing, designing, or appraising research) guidelines and resources are designed for:
        before: No clear instruction on what tasks reporting guidelines or their resources can and cannot be used for.
        before_example: See @fig-home-b4, @fig-db-b4, @fig-rg-intro-b4
        now: Clear instruction and differentiation of resources
        now_example: See @fig-home, @fig-rg-intro
        IF: Education
        BCT: Instruction on how to perform the behavior
        done: true
        evaluation_methods: 5 second test, think aloud, interview
  what-rgs-exist:
    ingredients:
      Instruct authors to cite reporting guidelines so readers may learn about them:
        before: No consistent instruction to cite reporting guidelines
        before_example:
        now: Consistent instruction to cite reporting guidelines
        now_example:
        IF: Education
        BCT: Instruction on how to perform the behavior
        done: true
        evaluation_methods: think aloud, interview
      # Encourage journals, ethics committees, funders, and other stakeholders to endorse reporting guidelines:
      #   before: Many journals endorsed reporting guidelines
      #   before_example:
      #   now: No change
      #   now_example:
      #   future: Encourage other funders, ethics committees and other stakeholders to adopt reporting guideline policies.^*^
      #   IF: Education
      #   BCT: social/material Incentive/reward depending on policy
      # Encourage all stakeholders to promote reporting guidelines:
      #   before: Few stakeholders run promotional campaigns to promote reporting guidelines (other than endorsing/enforcing them)
      #   before_example:
      #   now: No change
      #   now_example:
      #   hypothetical: All stakeholders could run promotional campaigns
      #   IF: Education
      #   BCT: #CHECK not a BCT? Could include multiple bcts
      # Install reporting champions; individuals that promote reporting guidelines within their organisation or peer group:
      #   before: Champions may exist informally
      #   before_example:
      #   now: No change
      #   now_example:
      #   hypothetical: Create a formal champion / ambassador network
      #   IF: Education
      #   BCT: same as above. This is a delivery option?
      Decision tools for discovering appropriate resources:
        before: We previously made a "reporting guideline wizard" but it was difficult to find.
        before_example: see @fig-home-b4
        now: Not included yet
        now_example:
        future: Reintroduce tool, extend and improve it.
        IF: Enablement
        BCT: Instruction on how to perform the behaviour
        done: false
        evaluation_methods: false
      Collections of related reporting guidelines:
        before: Collections exist on EQUATOR site but are difficult to find.
        before_example:
        now: Not included yet #could argue table on home page is kinda a collection, but It doesn't include extensions
        now_example: 
        future:  Create collection pages, link to them from home page table
        IF: Environmental Restructuring
        BCT: Adding objects to the environment
        done: false
        evaluation_methods: false
      Links between related guidelines:
        before: Guideline publications may cite guidelines published previously, but these can be buried in text and are not updated. EQUATOR website guideline pages feature links to extensions, but these may be hard to find. Checklists do not link to related resources.
        before_example: See @fig-db-b4, @fig-rg-intro-b4
        now: Guidelines prominently link to other relevant guidelines and explain when they should be used.
        now_example: See @fig-rg-intro
        future: Checklists, Templates, and all other resources will link to related guidelines.
        IF: Environmental Restructuring
        BCT: Restructuring the physical environment
        done: true
        evaluation_methods: false
      Embed reporting guidelines that "fit together":
        before: Checklists and their extensions are published separately. The best example of modular guidance is perhaps the JARS guidelines, but even these are published as separate documents.
        before_example:
        now: No change
        now_example:
        future: Allow extensions to be embedded within parent guidelines
        IF: Enablement
        BCT: Instruction on how to perform the behavior
        done: false
        evaluation_methods: false
  need-findable:
    ingredients:
      Centralised hosting:
        before: EQUATOR maintains a database of reporting guideline meta-data, but the guidance and checklists were published and hosted in different locations and in different ways.
        before_example:
        now: A core set of frequently accessed guidelines are now presented on a single website.
        now_example:
        future:  Extend the web intervention to include more reporting guidelines. Generate checklists and templates for each guideline. 
        IF: Enablement
        BCT: Restructuring the physical environment
        done: true
        evaluation_methods: false
      Search function on website:
        before: EQUATOR's search function was difficult to find.
        before_example: See @fig-home-b4
        now: Search function is easier to find as a recognizable icon in the navigation bar of every page. The home page includes additional ways to access search functionality.
        now_example: See @fig-home
        future: Improve search functionality
        IF: Enablement
        BCT: Restructuring the physical environment
        done: true
        evaluation_methods: false
      Search Engine Optimization:
        before: EQUATOR's website did not make use of some commonly used search optimization heuristics. It ranked well for guideline acronyms (like STROBE) but not for general terms that naive authors may use, like "observational epidemiology" or "how to write-up research". The site wasn't optimized for viewing on mobile devices, which will also harm google search rankings. 
        before_example: (Not visible)
        now: The site has additional meta-data. Each reporting guideline page has its own meta-data. The site is optimized for mobiles. 
        now_example: (Not visible)
        future: 
        IF: Enablement
        BCT: Restructuring the physical environment
        done: true
        evaluation_methods: false
      Permanent document object identifiers (DOIs):
        before: Although guideline publications have DOIs, tools (commonly hosted on guideline developer's websites) do not. EQUATOR's website does not use document object identifiers. If resources move (e.g. a website is reorganised or depreciated) then links can "die".
        before_example:
        now: No change
        now_example:
        future: All guidelines and related tools could have version-specific permanent identifiers
        IF: Enablement
        BCT: Restructuring the physical environment
        done: false
        evaluation_methods: false
  need-accessible:
    ingredients:
      Ensure guidelines and tools are open access:
        before: Some guidelines are published behind paywalls
        before_example:
        now: No change
        now_example:
        hypothetical: EQUATOR could arrange for paywalled guidance to become open, and can advise all future guidance to be published open access.
        IF: Enablement
        BCT: Restructuring the physical environment # good discussion point. Felt there should be a BCT for this. 
        done: false
        evaluation_methods: false
  scope:
    ingredients:
      Describe the scope of a reporting guideline at the top of every resource:
        before: Some reporting guidelines may describe their scope within a publication. Others might not, or may only describe their scope broadly without fully explaining the design assumptions within the guidance. Guideline publications rarely explain circumstances where the guidance should not be used. Checklists rarely define intended scope beyond the title of the guideline.
        before_example:
        now: The intended scope of a guideline is clearly & prominently described. This definition includes contexts in which the guidance should not be used.
        now_example: See @fig-rg-intro
        future: Checklists, templates and other tools will include scope descriptions.
        IF: Education
        BCT: Instruction on how to perform the behavior
        done: true
        evaluation_methods: think aloud, interview
  best-fit:
    ingredients:
      Use if-then rules to direct authors to more appropriate and up-to-date guidance when available:
        before: Reporting guidelines do not consistently point authors towards related resources that might be better fits. Guidelines are not updated as-and-when other guidelines become available. 
        before_example:
        now: Reporting guidelines clearly and consistently point authors to more appropriate guidance when appropriate, using if-then rules. These links can be updated any time. 
        now_example: See @fig-rg-intro
        IF: Education
        BCT: Instruction on how to perform the behavior
        done: true
        evaluation_methods: think aloud
      Explicitly state when no better guidance exists for a particular use case: 
        before: Reporting guidelines rarely explain what to do when no better guidance exists for a particular use case.
        before_example: 
        now: Reporting guidelines warn authors when no better guidance exists for a use case, and how the current guidance can be adapted instead
        now_example: See @fig-rg-intro
        IF: Education
        BCT: Instruction on how to perform the behavior

      #   now_example:
  need-translations:
    ingredients:
      Provide translations:
        before: Some guidelines have been translated, but many haven't. Links to translations are present on reporting guideline database pages but these links may not be easy to find. The EQUATOR website has an automatic translation tool which will translate content on web pages, but this doesn't cover the guidance itself. 
        before_example: SRQR was available in French but the translation wasn't advertised on the main guidance.
        before_example: See @fig-db-b4
        now: Translations are prominently listed above the guidance
        now_example: See @fig-rg-intro
        future: List translations on checklists and templates

  believed-costs:
    ingredients:
      Make guidance appear shorter by removing superfluous information, hiding optional content, splitting long guidelines, using concise language, and separating design advice:
        before: reporting guideline publications may include lengthy explanation of development, verbose language, and can be bloated by design advice
        before_example: See @fig-item-b4
        now: SRQR has been edited. The only text presented immediately is instruction on what the author needs to describe. Additional information is hidden at first and can be expanded. Text is shortened through editing and by using active voice. In the case of SRQR, this reduced the text length by 60%.
        now_example: See @fig-item
        future: Repeat for other guidelines.
        IF: Environmental restructuring
        BCT: Restructuring the physical environment
        done: true
        evaluation_methods: think aloud
      Cater to different kinds of user (readers vs dippers) by structuring guidance with headings, itemisation, hyperlinking to particular sections, and with optional content:
        before: Besides being split into items, reporting guidance is largely unstructured and different items can be organised in different ways. Checklist items do not link to items within an elaboration document.
        before_example: See @fig-item-b4
        now: SRQR items are structured consistently, making information easier to find. Itemisation is used consistently, content is hyperlinked when useful.
        now_example: See @fig-item
        future: Checklists, templates, and other tools link to full guidance items. Allow users to show or hide optional content (for example, hide all content that is unrelated to their particular use case).
        IF: Environmental restructuring
        BCT: Restructuring the physical environment
        done: true
        evaluation_methods: think aloud
      Include testimonials from researchers who were nervous about being punished for reporting transparently:
        before: No such testimonials exist
        before_example:
        now: Quotes included alongside guideline
        now_example:  see @fig-item
        future: Collect testimonials
        IF: Persuasion
        BCT: Demonstration of the behavior
        done: true
        evaluation_methods: think aloud, interview
      Decrease fear of judgement by making reporting guidelines design agnostic:
        before: Reporting guidelines may conflate reporting advice with design advice or design assumptions. The justification for why an item is important to describe is frequently presented in terms of good and bad design.
        before_example:
        now: SRQR explicitly states that it makes no assumptions about design. Inadvertent design assumptions were edited.
        now_example:
        future: Repeat with other reporting guidelines.
        IF: Coercion (Removal of)
        BCT: Remove aversive stimulus
        done: true
        evaluation_methods: plus minus
      Remove branding and messaging that may invoke feelings of judgement, complexity, or administrative red-tape:
        before: EQUATOR's website looked cluttered and visually unappealing. Guidance published in articles can look unappealing and dense. When justifying why authors should use reporting guidelines, guideline developers frequently referenced research waste, (lack of) transparency, bias, and poor design. 
        before_example: See @fig-home-b4 #TODO judgemental quote 
        now: A clean, simple interface for the home page and guidance pages. Text makes less use of to judgemental phrases and fewer references to the negative consequences of poor reporting.
        now_example: See @fig-home #TODO reassuring quote
        future: Further work on tone of voice
        IF: Coercion (Removal of)
        BCT: Remove aversive stimulus
        done: true
        evaluation_methods: think aloud
      Reassure that all research has limitations to encourage explanation over perfect design:
        before: Few guidelines would include this kind of reassurance
        before_example: See @fig-rg-intro-b4
        now: This reassurance appears on the home page and all guidance pages
        now_example: See @fig-rg-intro
        IF: Persuasion
        BCT: Social support (unspecified)
        done: true
        evaluation_methods: think aloud
  feel-not-my-job:
    ingredients:
      Address communications to authors:
        before: It wasn't immediately clear whether the EQUATOR guideline website was aimed at authors, editors, reviewers, or all. 
        # TODO are there any examples of "articles should include..." or "studies should report...", examples where the author isn't explicitly mentioned.
        before_example: #TODO quote in 3rd person
        now: All resources and website copy are directed predominantly at authors.
        now_example: #Quote in 1st person
        IF: Persuasion
        BCT: Instruction on how to perform a behaviour
        done: true
        evaluation_methods: interview
      Communicate why reporting is primarily the responsibility of the author:
        before: Because it wasn't clear how reporting guidelines and checklists should be used, they (especially checklists) could appear as administrative tasks that should be the responsibility of the editor or reviewer. 
        before_example:
        now: Clear explanation of why guidelines and tools should be used by authors primarily, although can also be used by others.
        now_example: 
        IF: Education
        BCT: Instruction on how to perform a behaviour
        done: false
  feel-not-a-job:
    ingredients:
      Educate authors about writing as a process:
        before: Many researchers don't get trained on writing as a process, they just do it. EQUATOR provided education about how to write but this wasn't advertised on guidelines.
        before_example:
        now: Some SRQR items now link to relevant EQUATOR materials and courses.
        now_example: See @fig-item
        IF: Education
        future: Deliver education to a wider audience. Influence curricula of other education programmes.
        BCT: Instruction on how to perform a behaviour
        done: true
        evaluation_methods: think aloud
Apply reporting guidance to writing:
  what-resources-exist:
    ingredients:
      link all resources to each other:
        before: Reporting guideline development articles, example and elaboration articles, and checklist files may not link to each other.
        before_example: See @fig-checklist-b4
        now: Guidance links to all tools and development article
        now_example: See @fig-rg-intro
        future: All tools to link back to guidance on an item-by-item basis.

        evaluation_methods: think aloud
  benefits:
    ingredients:
      Describe personal benefits and benefits to others where reporting guidelines are introduced (home page, on resources, in communications):
        before: Benefits are not prominently described on EQUATOR's home page, nor within the guideline publications. Benefits that are described may by hard to find, and often focus on hypothetical benefits to the research community, but not personal benefits to the author.
        before_example: See @fig-home-b4
        now: Benefits are prominently and consistently displayed across the home page and guidance pages. Descriptions prioritize personal benefits to the authors above hypothetical benefits to others.
        now_example: See @fig-rg-intro
        IF: Education
        BCT: Information about emotional consequences, Information about others' approval, Information about social and environmental consequences
        done: true
        evaluation_methods: 5 second test, interview
  believed-benefits:
    ingredients:
      Gather and communicate evidence for benefits:
        before: Benefits often presented without evidence (if at all)
        before_example: 
        now: Dummy quotes provides evidence for experienced benefits.
        now_example: See @fig-item
        future: Collect real testimonials and quotes. Collect real data regarding quantifiable benefits.
        IF: Persuasion
        BCT: Information about emotional consequences, Information about others' approval, Information about social and environmental consequences
        done: true
        evaluation_methods: think aloud
      Include design, features, and language to foster trust:
        before: Website design looked amateur. Citation metrics are available for guideline publications, but are not displayed on the EQUATOR website or within the guidance publications or checklists themselves. Guidelines were often preceeded by lengthy explanations of development.
        before_example: See @fig-db-b4
        now: Design looks professional. Citation metrics are presented at the top the reporting guidance. Information about who developed the guidelines, how they developed it, and why the guidance is credible is still provided, and easily findable from the top of the guidance.
        now_example: See @fig-rg-intro
        IF: Persuasion
        BCT: Credible source, Social comparison
        done: true
        evaluation_methods: think aloud
      Create spaces for authors to discuss reporting guidelines with others:
        before: There were no official on- or offline spaces for authors to discuss guidelines. 
        before_example:
        now: Each reporting item has its own discussion board.
        now_example: See @fig-discussion
        IF: Persuasion
        BCT: Social comparison, Credible source, Adding objects to the environment
        done: true
        evaluation_methods: think aloud, interview
      Use language and design to communicate personal benefits; confidence and simplicity:
        before: Guidance text made little use of a reassuring tone or words. The EQUATOR website and guideline articles looked dense and complex.
        before_example: See @fig-home-b4 and @fig-rg-intro-b4
        now: A clean, simple interface for the home page and guidance pages. Text uses phrases like "confidence", "quick", "maximum impact".
        now_example: See @fig-home and @fig-rg-intro
        IF: Persuasion
        BCT: Framing/reframing

  care-about-benefits:
    ingredients:
      # Create new benefits that are more meaningful e.g., by offering recognition of good reporting through a certification service:
      #   before: Benefits to the scientific community were often described. Personal benefits were rarely described, suggesting they aren't always considered by developers.
      #   before_example: #TODO quote
      #   now: No new benefits created
      #   now_example:
      #   hypothetical: EQUATOR could run a certification service. Certified articles could be attractive to journals, or could be used as examples of good reporting (and therefore attract attention)
      #   IF: Incentivization
      #   BCT:  Incentive and Reward (outcome) 
      Include testimonials from research users who benefit from complete reporting:
        before: Testimonials not included in reporting guidelines.
        before_example:

      #   before: Although many students are tasked with undertaking a systematic review, the primary focus of this is generally not to consider (in)complete reporting.
      #   before_example:
      #   now: No changes made
      #   now_example:
      #   hypothetical: EQUATOR could create resources (e.g. lesson plans / project plans) for educators/trainers, so that their students can experience the consequences of incomplete reporting when attempting a systematic review or replication study.

  understanding:
    ingredients:
      Use plain language:
        before: Although developers aspire to write clearly, authors may misinterpret guidance or fail to understand it completely.
        before_example: #TODO quote
        now: SRQR is edited to use plainer language.
        now_example: #TODO quote
        future: Continue to make language easier and easier to understand.

      Define key terms:
        before: Few guidelines came with a glossary. Some key terms may be defined within the guideline text. Including definitions this way makes them hard to find and elongates the guidance.
        before_example:
        now: SRQR now has a glossary, and text is marked-up with definitions that appear upon click.
        now_example: See @fig-item

        before_example: #TODO example?
        now: SRQR uses consistent terms across items.
