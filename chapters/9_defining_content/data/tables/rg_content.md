: Intervention components pertaining to the content and organisation of reporting guidelines, alongside the intervention functions and behaviour change techniques (BCT) they employ. A reporting guideline's content includes (but is not limited to) reporting *items*. Components specific to reporting items appear in @tbl-ics-item. Italicised items are duplicated from previous tables. See Appendix {{< var appendix.ict >}} for further descriptions and links to barriers each component addresses. {#tbl-ics-rg-content}
