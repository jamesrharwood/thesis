# Intervention Planning Table
Engage with (read) appropriate reporting guidance as early as possible:
  what-are-rgs:
    ingredients:
      Describe what RGs are where they are first encountered:
        before: No prominent description of what reporting guidelines are on EQUATOR home page or in RGs resources. 
        before_example: See @fig-home-b4, @fig-rg-intro-b4, @fig-checklist-b4, @fig-journal-instructions 
        now: Prominent definition on home page and guideline page.
        now_example: See @fig-home, @fig-rg-intro
        future: Advise stakeholders on how to introduce RGs.^*^
        IF: Education
      Differentiate resources and advice aimed at different tasks (writing vs designing vs appraising):
        before: No clear instruction on what tasks RGs can and cannot be used for.
        before_example: See @fig-home-b4, @fig-db-b4, @fig-rg-intro-b4
        now: Clear instruction and differentiation of resources
        now_example: See @fig-home, @fig-rg-intro
        IF: Education
  what-rgs-exist:
    ingredients:
      Instruct authors to cite reporting guidelines:
        before: No consistent instruction to cite reporting guidelines
        before_example:
        now: Consistent instruction to cite reporting guidelines
        now_example:
        IF: Education
      Encourage journals, ethics committees, funders, and other stakeholders to endorse reporting guidelines:
        before: Many journals endorsed reporting guidelines
        before_example:
        now: No change
        now_example:
        future: Encourage other funders, ethics committees and other stakeholders to adopt reporting guideline policies.^*^
        IF: Education
      Encourage all stakeholders to promote reporting guidelines:
        before: Few stakeholders run promotional campaigns to promote RGs (other than endorsing/enforcing them)
        before_example:
        now: No change
        now_example:
        hypothetical: All stakeholders could run promotional campaigns
        IF: Education
      Install reporting champions; individuals that promote reporting guidelines within their organisation or peer group:
        before: Champions may exist informally
        before_example:
        now: No change
        now_example:
        hypothetical: Create a formal champion / ambassador network
        IF: Education
      Decision tools for discovering resources:
        before: We previously made a "reporting guideline wizard" but it was difficult to find.
        before_example: (see @fig-home-b4)
        now: Not included yet
        now_example:
        future: Reintroduce tool, extend and improve it.
        IF: Enablement
      Collections of related reporting guidelines:
        before: Collections exist on EQUATOR site but are difficult to find
        before_example: See @fig-home-b4
        now: Home page includes a small table of collections
        now_example: See @fig-home
        future:  Create more collection pages, link to them from home page table
        IF: Environmental Restructuring
      Links between related guidelines:
        before: E&E articles may reference guidelines published previously, but these references can be buried in text, and E&Es are not updated to reference guidelines published subsequently. EQUATOR website guideline pages feature links to extensions, but these are hard to find. Checklists do not link to related resources.
        before_example: See @fig-db-b4, @fig-rg-intro-b4
        now: Guidelines prominently link to other relevant guidelines and explain when they should be used.
        now_example: See @fig-rg-intro
        future: Checklists, Templates, and all other resources will link to related guidelines.
        IF: Environmental Restructuring
      embed reporting guidelines that "fit together":
        before: Checklists and their extensions are published separately. The best example of modular guidance is perhaps the JARS guidelines, but even these are published as separate documents.
        before_example:
        now: No change
        now_example:
        future: Allow extensions to be embedded within parent guidelines
        IF: Enablement
  need-findable:
    ingredients:
      Centralised hosting:
        before: EQUATOR maintained a database of reporting guideline meta-data, but the guidance and checklists were published and hosted in different locations and in different ways.
        before_example:
        now: A core set of frequently accessed guidelines are now presented on a single website in a consistent structure and format, alongside all of their checklists, templates, and other tools.
        now_example:
        future: Extend the web intervention to include more reporting guidelines.
        IF: Enablement
      Search function on website:
        before: EQUATOR's search function was difficult to find.
        before_example:
        now: Search function is easier to find. A recognizable icon appears in the navigation bar of every page, and the home page includes additional ways to access search functionality.
        now_example:
        future: Improve search functionality^*^
        IF: Enablement
      Search Engine Optimization:
        before: EQUATOR's website did not make use of some commonly used search optimization heuristics. It ranked well for guideline acronyms (like STROBE) but not for general terms that naive authors may use, like "observational epidemiology".
        before_example:
        now: Site has meta data required by search engines
        now_example:
        future: Optimize the site for search engines
        IF: Enablement
      Permanent links (DOIs):
        before: Although guideline publications have DOIs, tools (commonly hosted on guideline developer's websites) do not. EQUATOR's website does not use document object identifiers. If resources move (e.g. a website is reorganised or depreciated) then links can "die".
        before_example:
        now: No change
        now_example:
        future: All guidelines and related tools could have version-specific permanent identifiers
        IF: Enablement
  need-accessible:
    ingredients:
      Ensure guidelines and tools are open access:
        before: Some guidelines are published behind paywalls
        before_example:
        now: No change
        now_example:
        hypothetical: EQUATOR could paywalled guidance to become open, and can advise all future guidance to be open.
        IF: Enablement
  scope:
    ingredients:
      Describe the scope of a reporting guideline at the top of every resource:
        before: Some reporting guidelines may describe their scope within their E&E. Others might not, or may only describe their scope broadly without fully explaining the design assumptions within the guidance. Guidelines would not explain circumstances where the guidance should not be used. Checklists rarely define intended scope beyond the title of the guideline.
        before_example:
        now: The intended scope of a guideline is clearly & prominently described. This definition includes contexts in which the guidance should not be used. #TODO
        now_example:
        future: Checklists, templates and other tools will include scope descriptions.
        IF: Education
  best-fit:
    ingredients:
      Use if-then rules to direct authors to more appropriate guidance when available:
        before: Reporting guidelines do not consistently point authors towards related resources that might be better fits. If a reporting guideline E&E _does_ do this, this advice becomes out of date as and when new guidelines are published.
        before_example:
        now: Reporting guidelines clearly and consistently point authors to more appropriate guidance when appropriate, using if-then rules.  
        now_example:
        IF: Education
      Explicitly state when no better guidance exists for a particular use case: 
        before: Guideline E&Es do not consistently explain what to do when no better guidance exists for their use case
        before_example: See @fig-rg-intro-b4
        now: Guidelines warn authors when no better guidance exists for a use case, and how the current guidance can be adapted instead
        now_example: See @fig-rg-intro
        IF: Education
      Decision tools (see above):
        before:
        before_example:
        now:
        now_example:
  need-translations:
    ingredients:
      provide translations of resources:
        before: Translations were listed on EQUATOR database pages, but not on the guidance or checklists
        before_example: See @fig-db-b4
        now: Translations are prominently listed above the guidance
        now_example: See @fig-rg-intro
        future: List translations on checklists and templates
        IF: Enablement
  believed-costs:
    ingredients:
      Make guidance appear shorter by removing superfluous parts, hiding optional content, splitting long guidelines, using concise language, and separating design advice:
        before: RG publications may include lengthy explanation of development, verbose language, and can be bloated by design advice
        before_example: See @sec-box-item-b4
        now: The only information presented immediately is what to describe. Additional information is hidden at first and can be expanded. Text is shortened through editing and by using active voice. Overall, this reduces the text length by 60%.
        now_example: See @sec-box-item
        # TODO make sure now only refers to SRQR. Put all other guidelines into future
        future:
        IF: Environmental restructuring
      Cater to different kinds of user (readers vs dippers) by structuring guidance with headings, itemisation, hyperlinking to particular sections, and with dynamic content:
        before: Besides being split into items, reporting guidance is largely unstructured, and different items can be structured in different ways. Checklist items do not link to items within the E&E.
        before_example: See @sec-box-item-b4
        now: SRQR items are structured consistently, making information easier to find.
        now_example: See @sec-box-item
        future: Checklists, templates, and other tools link to full guidance items.
        IF: Environmental restructuring
      Include testimonials from researchers who were nervous about being punished for reporting transparently:
        before: No such testimonials exist
        before_example:
        now: No change #DECIDE Guidelines include mockup (dummy) quotes and testimonials for the purpose of piloting SRQR. 
        now_example:
        #TODO mock quotes for SRQR
        future: Collect testimonials
        IF: Persuasion
      Decrease fear of judgement by making reporting guidelines design agnostic:
        before: Reporting guidelines may conflate reporting advice with design advice or design assumptions. The justification for why an item is important to describe is frequently presented in terms of good and bad design.
        before_example:
        now: SRQR explicitly states that it makes no assumptions about design. Where design advice was given, this has been moved to a separate page.
        now_example:
        future: Repeat with other reporting guidelines.
        IF: Coercion (Removal of)
        # TODO need to remove design advice
      Remove branding and messaging that may invoke feelings of judgement, complexity, or administrative red-tape:
        before: EQUATOR's website looked cluttered and visually unappealing. Guidance published in articles can look unappealing, depending on the publisher. Reporting guidance made frequent reference to waste, (lack of) transparency, bias, and poor design. 
        before_example: See @fig-home-b4 #TODO judgemental quote 
        now: A clean, simple interface for the home page and guidance pages. Text makes less use of to judgemental phrases.
        now_example: See @fig-home #TODO reassuring quote
        future: Further work on tone of voice
        IF: Coercion (Removal of)
      Reassure that all research has limitations and encourage explanation over perfection:
        before: Few guidelines would include this kind of reassurance
        before_example: See @fig-rg-intro-b4
        now: This reassurance appears on the home page and all guidance pages
        now_example: See @fig-rg-intro
        IF: Persuasion
  feel-not-my-job:
    ingredients:
      Address communications to authors:
        before: It wasn't immediately clear whether the EQUATOR guideline website was aimed at authors, editors, reviewers, or all. Guidance was written in third person and would generally be worded as "authors should describe how...", but it wouldn't always be clear who was expected to use a checklist. 
        # TODO are there any examples of "articles should include..." or "studies should report...", examples where the author isn't explicitly mentioned.
        before_example: #TODO quote in 3rd person
        now: All resources and website copy are directed predominantly at authors.
        now_example: #Quote in 1st person
        IF: Persuasion
        BCT: Instruction on how to perform a behaviour #ASK not self as role model
      Communicate why reporting is the responsibility of the author and not an editor or reviewer:
        before: Because it wasn't clear how reporting guidelines and checklists should be used, they (especially checklists) could appear as administrative tasks that should be the responsibility of the editor or reviewer. 
        before_example:
        now: Clearer description of how guidelines and tools should be used and who should use them. #DECIDE
        now_example: See @sec-box-FAQ
        BCT: Instruction on how to perform a behaviour #ASK
  feel-not-a-job:
    ingredients:
      Educate about writing as a process:
        before: EQUATOR provided education about how to write
        before_example:
        now: Guidelines link to this education #DECIDE
        now_example: See @sec-box-item
        IF: Education
        future: Deliver education to a wider audience. Influence curricula of other education programmes
        #TODO link to this training
        BCT: Instruction on how to perform a behaviour
      Provide training and education about writing as a process:
        before: EQUATOR provided training about how to write
        before_example:
        now: Guidelines link to this training
        now_example: See @sec-box-item #DECIDE
        future: Deliver training to a wider audience. Influence curricula of other training programmes
        BCT: Instruction on how to perform a behaviour
        IF: Training
Apply reporting guidance to writing:
  what-resources-exist:
    ingredients:
      link all resources to each other:
        before: Development articles, E&E articles, and checklist files may not link to each other.
        before_example: See @fig-checklist-b4
        now: Guidance links to all tools and development article
        now_example: See @fig-rg-intro
        future: All tools to link back to guidance on an item-by-item basis.
        IF: Environmental restructuring
  benefits:
    ingredients:
      Describe personal benefits and benefits to others where reporting guidelines are introduced (home page, on resources, in communications):
        before: Benefits are not prominently described on EQUATOR's home page, nor within the guideline publications. Benefits that are described may by hard to find, and often focus on hypothetical benefits to the research community, but not personal benefits to the author.
        before_example: See @fig-home-b4
        now: Benefits are prominently and consistently displayed across the home page and guidance pages. Descriptions prioritize personal benefits to the authors above hypothetical benefits to others.
        now_example: See @fig-rg-intro
        IF: Education
  believed-benefits:
    ingredients:
      Gather and communicate evidence for benefits:
        before: Benefits often presented without evidence (if at all)
        before_example: #TODO quote from EQUATOR Network?
        now: A dummy quote provides evidence for experienced benefits.
        now_example: #TODO quote
        future: Collect real testimonials and quotes
        hypothetical: Collect real data regarding quantifiable benefits.
        IF: Persuasion
      Display citation metrics:
        before: Citation metrics are available for guideline publications, but are not displayed on the EQUATOR website or within the guidance or checklists themselves.
        before_example: See @fig-db-b4
        now: Citation metrics are presented at the top of each reporting guideline.
        now_example: See @fig-rg-intro
        IF: Persuasion
      Create spaces for authors to see other authors using reporting guidelines:
        before: There were no official on or offline spaces for authors to witness other users discussing guidelines.
        before_example:
        now: Each reporting item has a discussion board.
        now_example: See @fig-discussion
        IF: Persuasion
      Use language to communicate personal benefits; confidence and simplicity:
        before: Guidance text made little use of a reassuring tone or words. The EQUATOR website and guideline articles looked dense and complex.
        before_example: See @fig-home-b4 and @fig-rg-intro-b4
        now: A clean, simple interface for the home page and guidance pages. Text uses phrases like "confidence", "quick", "maximum impact".
        now_example: See @fig-home and @fig-rg-intro
        IF: Persuasion
  care-about-benefits:
    ingredients:
      Create new benefits that are more meaningful e.g., by offering recognition of good reporting through a certification service:
        before: Benefits to the scientific community were often described. Personal benefits were rarely described, suggesting they aren't always considered by developers.
        before_example: #TODO quote
        now: No new benefits created
        now_example:
        hypothetical: EQUATOR could run a certification service. Certified articles could be attractive to journals, or could be used as examples of good reporting (and therefore attract attention)
        IF: Incentivization
      Include testimonials from research users who benefit from complete reporting:
        before: Testimonials not included in reporting guidelines.
        before_example:
        now: SRQR includes dummy testimonials and quotes from research users
        now_example: #TODO quote
        future: Collect real testimonials and quotes
        IF: Persuasion
      Create training that helps students experience, first hand, the benefits of RGs and consequence of poor reporting:
        before: Although many students are tasked with undertaking a systematic review, the primary focus of this is generally not to consider (in)complete reporting.
        before_example:
        now: No changes made
        now_example:
        hypothetical: EQUATOR could create resources (e.g. lesson plans / project plans) for educators/trainers, so that their students can experience the consequences of incomplete reporting when attempting a systematic review or replication study.
        IF: Training
  understanding:
    ingredients:
      use plain language:
        before: Although developers aspire to write clearly, authors may misinterpret guidance or fail to understand it completely.
        before_example: #TODO quote
        now: SRQR is edited to use plainer language.
        now_example: #TODO quote
        future: Continue to make language easier and easier to understand.
        IF: Enablement
      define key terms:
        before: Few guidelines came with a glossary. Some key terms may be defined within the guideline text. Including definitions this way makes them hard to find and elongates the guidance.
        before_example:
        now: SRQR now has a glossary, and text is marked-up with definitions that appear upon click.
        now_example: See @sec-box-item
        future: Add glossaries to all other guidelines.
        IF: Education
      use consistent terms:
        before: Guidelines may use different terms to refer to the same thing. A single guideline may do this too.
        before_example: #TODO example?
        now: SRQR uses consistent terms across items.
        now_example: #TODO example?
        future: Repeat for other reporting guidelines.
        IF: Enablement
      provide translations:
        before: Some guidelines have been translated, but many haven't. The EQUATOR website uses an automatic translation tool, but this doesn't cover the guidance itself. Translations aren't always easy to find.
        before_example: SRQR was available in French but the translation wasn't advertised on the main guidance.
        now: Translations are linked at the top of the guidance.
        now_example: See @fig-rg-intro
        hypothetical: EQUATOR could arrange for key guidelines to be translated into popular languages.
        IF: Enablement
      provide channels for feedback and support (see above):
        before:
        before_example:
        now:
        now_example:
        IF: 
  importance:
    ingredients:
      For each item, explain why the *information* is important and to whom (regardless of whether a particular design choice is important):
        before: Sometimes there was no explanation as to why an item should be reported. Other times the justification would be about why a particular design choice was important.
        before_example: See @sec-box-item-b4
        now: Informaiton added
        now_example: See @sec-box-item
        hypothetical: Repeat for other reporting guidelines
        IF: Education
      For each item, indicate any conditions which modify importance:
        before: It might not always be made clear when an item is only applicable in certain circumstances
        before_example:
        now: No changes made
        now_example:
        hypothetical: Add information for all reporting guidelines
        IF: Education
      Explain importance of complete reporting to the scientific community:
        before: EQUATOR and most RGs do this already
        before_example:
        now: Continue to do this
        now_example:
        IF: Education
  how-to-do:
    ingredients:
      Provide links to other resources that explain how an item can be done:
        before: Some RG E&Es include instruction in text but many don't. SRQR did not.
        before_example:
        now: Links included when relevant.
        now_example: See @sec-box-item
  how-to-report:
    ingredients:
      For each item, provide clear instruction of what needs to be described:
        before: Writing instructions are often mixed in with other explanation and context.
        now: Writing instruction occurs first for each item.
        before_example:
        now_example: See @sec-box-item
        IF: Education
      For each item, provide examples of reporting in different contexts:
        before: Not all RGs provide examples. Examples may not cover different contexts.
        now: Additional examples #DECIDE
        before_example:
        now_example: See @sec-box-item
        IF: modelling
      Discussion spaces (see above):
        before: No formal discussion spaces existed. Authors may use platforms like Twitter.
        now: Each item is linked to its own discussion board.
        before_example:
        now_example: See @fig-discussion
        IF: Enablement
  how-to-report-not-done:
    ingredients:
      Provide clear instruction of what needs to be described when an item was not done, could not be done, or does not apply:
        before: Rarely instructed
        now: Instructed where relevant
        before_example: See @sec-box-item-b4
        now_example: See @sec-box-item
        IF: Education
      Provide examples of reporting "imperfect" items:
        before: Examples not provided
        now: No changes made
        before_example:
        now_example: 
        future: Add more examples
        IF: Modelling
  need-enough-time:
    ingredients:
      Ensure resources (checklists and templates) are in ready-to-use formats:
        before: Some checklists not in immediately usable formats e.g., PDFs
        now: No changes made #DECIDE
        future: Each RG should have resources that can be used immediately
        before_example:
        now_example:
        IF: Enablement
      Structure guidance to make it quicker to digest (see above):
        before: E&E documents not structured below the item level
        now: Items have consistent structure
        before_example: See [box @sec-box-item-b4]
        now_example: See [box @sec-box-item]
        IF: Enablement
      Indicate priority of items for authors that are short on time:
        before: ARRIVE indicates priority, other RGs including SRQR do not.
        now: No changes made
        before_example:
        now_example:
        IF: Enablement
      Tell authors how long the guidance will take to read:
        before: Estimated reading time not given
        now: Estimated reading time given
        before_example:
        now_example: See @fig-rg-intro
        IF: Education
      Tell authors how long guidance will take to apply:
        before: No advice given
