Demonstrated a data driven, systematic approach to intervention design. Number of components, number of functions, number of barriers. 

Number of components remaining that Equator could deliver. Funding applications. 

Number of components that others could deliver. Previously unthought of. 

First realisation of a RG intervention where each part is designed and defined by BCT. Previously the website and guidelines may well have had elements, but they were there haphazardly, organically. 

Things yes to do before it can go into production

Immediate implications - pilot

Mid term implications - real-world testing

Long term implications - a scalable intervention that can be used by reporting guidelines authors off the shelf


Although data driven, still a lot of subjectivity. Eg design choices. But the intended function served as an anchor or yard stick so instead of relying on personal preferences participants could refer to intended function. Some felt that including multiple team members helped as we were less swayed by individual peculiarities. 

Limitations. Existing system is both. Limits imagination. What would we have made if EQUATOR didn’t exist? Or if RGs didn’t exist? If consort didn’t already exist, might they have taken a more Modular approach like jars? If no RGs existed, would we have still decided to create a system that mainly intervenes at publishing time? Should I have focused my time making resources for funders? But by improving something that already exists, we can be more certain of acceptability and practicality. 

It would have been useful to include authors in the design workshops. 

Why didn’t I do an analysis of existing RG system?

Next steps - future work, pilot
