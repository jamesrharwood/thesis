## Introduction

Having defined intervention components and built a prototype (chapter {{< var chapters.redesign >}}) I wanted to refine the website by getting feedback from authors. Although I had included evidence from authors in my earlier work, this evidence came from secondary sources many of which had limitations. Many studies were free-form text surveys which resulted in thin description, and samples generally lacked diversity; almost all participants came from western academic institutions. To refine my website, I wanted to capture rich descriptions of experiences from authors from around the world, with different levels of experience, and different places of work. This was especially important as I hadn't involved authors earlier in the design or development process.

Chose SRQR because of varied author base. Because its users will include students, and experts, and small Q and big Q, and academics and non-academics, I felt the results would be more generalisable. If I had gone with a more niche guideline - say TRIPOD - then I may have struggled to recruit as many students/nonacademics. I could have selected PRISMA (lots of students), but I was less familiar with it. Also, I was aware that RGs may be less accepted by qualitative researchers who may struggle because of the variation in paradigm and in the structure of manuscripts (e.g. iterative, or combining results and discussion).
