### Recruitment

Recruitment ran from 21/03/2023 until 9/08/2023. The number of people expressing interest, eligible, consenting, and participating and shown in @tbl-interview-recruitment, as are the reasons for drop out. Eleven people participated. Two dropped out before the second interview, without giving a reason. Participants' characteristics are summarized in @tbl-interview-participants and included variety in research experience (from 1 to 10+ years), subject area, country of origin, first language, and experience in using reporting guidelines. Seven participants had never heard of reporting guidelines before, one had but did not remember whether they had used one, two had used a guideline before, and one had used many reporting guidelines before. The first interview lasted between 45 minutes - 1.5 hours, and the second interview lasted 30-45 minutes.

### Design Iteration

I had originally planned to finish data collection before making any changes to the website. However, the first five participants consistently mentioned #TODO deficiencies pertaining to #TODO components. After reflecting and discussing with UK EQUATOR staff, we agreed these deficiencies would likely affect many authors and diminish the website's success, and so we decided to iterate our design. The components we changed, deficiencies, quotes, and modifications are in #TODO table.

### Main findings

`
* The purpose of this study was to identify deficiencies in a redesigned reporting guideline and EQUATOR Network home page. I identified #TODO deficiencies, pertaining to #TODO components. #TODO components were deficient in more than one way, #TODO components received praise with no mention of deficiency, and #TODO components were not mentioned by participants at all. Table #TODO shows themes, quotes, and codes, for each intervention component. I have described simple deficiencies only in the table, but I will not discuss some in more detail. I have chosen these deficiencies because they were frequently mentioned or involved interactions between components.

#### Detailed themes

#### Intervention components not mentioned 

* Some were not tested
* For some, it is good that they were not mentioned
* For others, might be because they were not prominent or they were nuanced.
