The context in which users encounter the website will effect how it is perceived. 

Most visitors come from journal websites, having been instructed by an editor or JAI page to use a particular reporting guideline. Others may come to the site because a a guideline has been recommended by a friend. Very few arrive completely cold turkey. 

In contrast to this study, where all participants were totally cold (unless they were already familiar with EQUATOR). 

So when one participant suggested that "What are RGs" should come above the Frequently Accessed Guidelines (Or at least that the writing, checking, planning should) this may appear sensible on the surface. But given that most authors will come already with a guideline's name in mind (even if they don't really know what it is), this ight not be necessary. 

Therefore, need a real world evaluation.

All could speak English = bias

Not all intervention components explored directly. E.g. the think aloud was good at detecting things that were salient (good or bad). Not good at detecting neutral things. 

Task based protocol or navigation task might have been better. E.g. "look for french version" or "imagine you needed to cite this, where would you look" - which I did kinda do as an interview question.

The problem of finding the right guideline still deserves exploration. Need the other guidelines to be up, and would need to either give tasks or recruit people differently (not by the kind of research they were doing).
