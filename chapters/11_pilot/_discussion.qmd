The context in which users encounter the website will effect how it is perceived. 

Most visitors come from journal websites, having been instructed by an editor or JAI page to use a particular reporting guideline. Others may come to the site because a a guideline has been recommended by a friend. Very few arrive completely cold turkey. 

In contrast to this study, where all participants were totally cold (unless they were already familiar with EQUATOR). 

So when one participant suggested that "What are RGs" should come above the Frequently Accessed Guidelines (Or at least that the writing, checking, planning should) this may appear sensible on the surface. But given that most authors will come already with a guideline's name in mind (even if they don't really know what it is), this ight not be necessary. 

Therefore, need a real world evaluation.

All could speak English = bias
