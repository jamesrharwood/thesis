<section id="introduction" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Having defined intervention components and built a prototype (chapter 10) I wanted to refine the home page and SRQR guidance page (“the website”) by getting feedback from authors.</p>
<p>The MRC guidance on complex interventions, the Person Based Approach, and the Behaviour Change Wheel all stress the importance of including service users in the design of complex interventions <span class="citation" data-cites="skivingtonNewFrameworkDeveloping2021">[<a href="#ref-skivingtonNewFrameworkDeveloping2021" role="doc-biblioref">1</a>]</span>; <span class="citation" data-cites="michieBehaviourChangeWheel2011">[<a href="#ref-michieBehaviourChangeWheel2011" role="doc-biblioref">2</a>]</span>; <span class="citation" data-cites="yardleyPersonBasedApproachIntervention2015">[<a href="#ref-yardleyPersonBasedApproachIntervention2015" role="doc-biblioref">3</a>]</span>. Service users can help identify deficiencies which, if addressed, would make the intervention more successful <span class="citation" data-cites="skivingtonNewFrameworkDeveloping2021">[<a href="#ref-skivingtonNewFrameworkDeveloping2021" role="doc-biblioref">1</a>]</span>. Involving service users can also help researchers better understand barriers, and whether intervention components are functioning as intended.</p>
<p>In this study, I wanted to address limitations I had identified in my thematic synthesis (chapter 3), where I found testing reporting guidelines with users is rarely done, and often suffers from thin description and unrepresentative participants lacking diversity. In contrast, I wanted to obtain rich data from a diverse group of authors. In chapter 10 I positioned SRQR as a good guideline to test with users because its wide scope includes qualitative methods used by many researchers, from many fields, with varying levels of experience. Thus SRQR offered potential to recruit a diverse sample.</p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p></p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><span class="">STRETCH Can you ground this is some web design literature perhaps too, showing your an always improve things and it can’t be perfect? (CA)</span></div></div>
<p>I did not aspire to perfect the website, as I did not believe an optimal design exists. Instead, I viewed the design process as iterative, and the purpose of this study was to collect evidence to inform future iterations. Instead of asking authors to suggest improvements (I suspect this strategy would have led to superficial suggestions or blank faces), I was more interested in identifying <em>deficiencies</em>. I defined a deficiency as any website element that, if modified, could better facilitate the website’s intended target behaviour (successful application of reporting guidance). I used the term <em>deficiency</em> over and above <em>barrier</em> or <em>facilitator</em> because it includes both (if a facilitator could be improved, it is deficient). In the future, EQUATOR and I will be able to identify modifications to address these deficiencies.</p>
</section>
<section id="methods" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="methods">Methods</h2>
<p>The purpose of this study was to identify deficiencies in a redesigned reporting guideline and EQUATOR Network home page (“the website”).</p>
<p>My objectives were to:</p>
<ul>
<li>explore the experience of a diverse sample of authors,</li>
<li>and to identify and understand deficiencies.</li>
</ul>
<section id="sampling-strategy" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sampling-strategy">Sampling strategy</h3>
<p>My purposive sample of authors varied in their:</p>
<ul>
<li>years of academic experience,</li>
<li>subject area,</li>
<li>their first language,</li>
<li>and their country of residence.</li>
</ul>
<p>This variation was important because my thematic synthesis (chapter 3) suggested inexperienced authors may have the most to benefit from reporting guidelines, but also face the most hurdles. Inexperience may be due to early career stage, being new to a field or study design, or new to academic writing. My synthesis also suggested language barriers could hinder adherence, and my service evaluation of EQUATOR’s existing website (chapter 5) revealed a highly international userbase.</p>
<p>Authors were eligible to participate if they were currently engaged in research utilizing qualitative methods, and if they were able to attend an online interview conducted in English.</p>
<p>I recruited through four channels:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>I posted on X (called Twitter at the time).</li>
<li>I advertised through Penelope.ai <span class="citation" data-cites="PenelopeAi">[<a href="#ref-PenelopeAi" role="doc-biblioref">4</a>]</span>, the manuscript checker I created before starting my PhD. Many medical journals offer the tool to submitting authors. BMJ Open is the largest of these journals, and enjoys a large, international, author base.</li>
<li>I invited researchers from a research consultancy in the Philippines.</li>
<li>I wrote to Chinese researchers who had published qualitative research and about the experience of doing qualitative research in China, and I asked them to share my recruitment advert. One of the researchers I contacted posted the advert on internet forums used by Chinese students.</li>
</ol>
<p>All channels invited authors to signal their interest by email. To check applicants’ eligibility as qualitative researchers, I asked them to describe their research methods in a few sentences over email. I excluded applicants if their descriptions made no reference of a qualitative method.</p>
<p>I sent all eligible applicants the participant information sheet and consent form. I used JISC Online Surveys #REF to obtain consent and ask the following demographic questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many years have you done research?</li>
<li>Please describe your research in a couple of sentences</li>
<li>What is your first language?</li>
<li>What country do you work and live in?</li>
</ul>
<p>I offered participants £50 reimbursement in return for an expected 2 hour commitment. This was a delivered as an Amazon voucher to UK participants, and a bank transfer to international participants. My recruitment advert, information sheet, consent form, and email templates are in Appendix #TODO.</p>
<p>Time and money limited my target sample size to 10 participants. As argued by Nielsen and Launder <span class="citation" data-cites="nielsenMathematicalModelFinding1993">[<a href="#ref-nielsenMathematicalModelFinding1993" role="doc-biblioref">5</a>]</span>, small samples (fewer than 10) are often sufficient to identify the majority of deficiencies. In chapter 8 I introduced information power <span class="citation" data-cites="malterudSampleSizeQualitative2016">[<a href="#ref-malterudSampleSizeQualitative2016" role="doc-biblioref">6</a>]</span> as a concept to guide sample size in qualitative research, and I drew upon it again in this study. I maximised information power firstly by using methods to elicit rich information from each participant. Secondly, I used my table of intervention components (9) as an analysis framework. Hence I anticipated a sample of 10 to sufficiently inform at least one design iteration at the end of data collection.</p>

<p>I wanted my study to resemble the ways authors will experience the website in real life. Firstly, interview sessions took place online using Microsoft Teams. This meant participants could view the website on their own computer, using their normal browser, in their usual place of work. This would allow me to identify problems with slow-loading over bad internet connections and display problems on different screen resolutions, whilst avoiding difficulties of asking a participant to use an unfamiliar computer or browser.</p>
<p>Secondly, I wanted to replicate the experience of encountering a new website as a naïve user, gradually exploring content, and then reading and applying guidance to one’s own writing. I did this by using a variety of methods:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>5 second test to capture initial reactions</li>
<li>Think aloud to capture exploration</li>
<li>Plus-minus task</li>
<li>A writing evaluation</li>
<li>Semi structured interviews throughout.</li>

<p>My interview schedule (appendix #TODO) included the verbal instructions for each task and topic guides for each semi-structured interview. I tested the interview schedule by doing a mock interview with a student at Oxford University.</p>
<p>I began sessions by introducing myself as part of team creating a new website. To encourage open and truthful feedback I reassured participants the best way they could help was by being honest, not to worry about critiquing the website or offending me, and to share positive <em>and</em> negative feedback. I asked participants to tell me a little about themselves to relax into the interview and help them feel comfortable talking, before moving on to the first task: the 5 second test.</p>
<section id="five-second-test" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="five-second-test">Five second test</h4>
<p>Until this point, participants had no idea what the website was about. My recruitment materials and interview introduction made no mention of writing nor reporting guidelines, and so participants were blind to the website’s purpose.</p>
<p>The five second test is an “in the moment” survey method <span class="citation" data-cites="UXFiveSecondRules2014">[<a href="#ref-UXFiveSecondRules2014" role="doc-biblioref">7</a>]</span>. By sharing my screen, I showed participants the top of the home page for five seconds before removing it and asking questions. The test limits exposure to five seconds because although a participant can absorb much information (colours, words, shapes), five seconds is rarely sufficient to make sense of everything as a whole. The aim is to capture participant’s immediate reactions to salient design elements (like images, large words) before they have a change to consider the content more critically. Furthermore, this five second limit was relevant because my website service evaluation found many authors leave EQUATOR’s website within five seconds without interacting with it.</p>
<p>This test was appropriate for the top of the home page because, as per best practice, the area has little text, all relevant content is visible in one frame, and I asked few questions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>What do you think the website is about?</li>
<li>How do you think this website may affect your work?</li>
</ol>
<p>If participants answered the first question with “reporting guidelines”, I asked “what do you think reporting guidelines are?”. If participant’s answers did not mention writing, I asked what stages of research they might use the website.</p>
<p>I designed these questions to explore three intervention ingredients: describe what reporting guidelines are, how they can be best used, and their benefits. These are the main ingredients featured at the top of the home page.</p>
</section>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="semi-structured-interview-1---prior-experience-with-reporting-guidelines">Semi structured interview 1 - prior experience with reporting guidelines</h4>
<p>After the five second test it was no longer necessary to keep participants blinded, and so I asked participants about their prior awareness of, or experience with, reporting guidelines. I asked which guidelines they had used and what they had used them for.</p>
</section>
<section id="think-aloud-1---home-screen" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="think-aloud-1---home-screen">Think aloud 1 - home screen</h4>
<p>Website designers often ask participant’s to “think aloud” as they complete a task or view a website as a way of exploring participants’ thought processes (e.g. <span class="citation" data-cites="szinayInfluencesUptakeHealth2021">[<a href="#ref-szinayInfluencesUptakeHealth2021" role="doc-biblioref">8</a>]</span>; <span class="citation" data-cites="yardleyUnderstandingReactionsInternetdelivered2010">[<a href="#ref-yardleyUnderstandingReactionsInternetdelivered2010" role="doc-biblioref">9</a>]</span>). Think aloud as a method was first described by cognitive psychologists Ericsson and Simon <span class="citation" data-cites="laffalEricssonAndersSimon1985">[<a href="#ref-laffalEricssonAndersSimon1985" role="doc-biblioref">10</a>]</span>. Their strict approach viewed verbalizations as “indicators of what information was heeded and in what order, a sort of time stamp of the contents of short-term memory” <span class="citation" data-cites="borenThinkingAloudReconciling2000">[<a href="#ref-borenThinkingAloudReconciling2000" role="doc-biblioref">11</a>]</span>. As user experience testers adopted the method, they used it more flexibly to additionally capture participants’ thoughts, feelings, and expectations <span class="citation" data-cites="borenThinkingAloudReconciling2000">[<a href="#ref-borenThinkingAloudReconciling2000" role="doc-biblioref">11</a>]</span>. Whereas cognitive psychologists use the method to understand cognitive processes, usability testers use it to “support the development of usable systems by identifying system deficiencies”. Because “building robust models of human cognition is not a central concern”, Ericsson and Simon’s fixed approach is less appropriate, and testers use a more flexible and pragmatic approach to data collection and interpretation <span class="citation" data-cites="borenThinkingAloudReconciling2000">[<a href="#ref-borenThinkingAloudReconciling2000" role="doc-biblioref">11</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>As per best practice <span class="citation" data-cites="borenThinkingAloudReconciling2000">[<a href="#ref-borenThinkingAloudReconciling2000" role="doc-biblioref">11</a>]</span> I began by explaining the task, and giving instruction to continually verbalize a train of thought. I then demonstrated by sharing my screen, opening up a different website, and “thinking aloud” for a minute. Participants then shared their screen as they explored the home page. Whenever participants stopped talking, I would prompt them openly to continue by asking “What are you thinking?”. I acknowledged participants’ verbalizations with neutral sounds like “uh-hu” and “mmm”, which encourage further talk, but do not show agreement or disgareement. These verbalizations and prompts are also considered best practice <span class="citation" data-cites="borenThinkingAloudReconciling2000">[<a href="#ref-borenThinkingAloudReconciling2000" role="doc-biblioref">11</a>]</span>.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="semi-structured-interview-2---home-page">Semi-structured interview 2 - home page</h4>
<p>Once participants had explored the entire home page, I asked participants about any intervention components they had not talked about in the think aloud, about their overall opinions, and whether their understanding had changed since first viewing it.</p>
</section>
<section id="think-aloud-2---srqr-guideline-page" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="think-aloud-2---srqr-guideline-page">Think aloud 2 - SRQR guideline page</h4>
<p>I asked participants to find the relevant guideline for reporting qualitative research, and then to continue thinking aloud as they explored it. The top of the SRQR page included information about the guideline, such as its scope, and the number of journals endorsing it.</p>
</section>
<section id="semi-structured-interview-3---srqr-guideline-page" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="semi-structured-interview-3---srqr-guideline-page">Semi-structured interview 3 - SRQR guideline page</h4>
<p>Because the SRQR guidance is long, I stopped participants from thinking aloud once they reached the guidance itself. I then used semi-structured interview questions to explore any intervention components missed by the think aloud, and to explore participants’ expectations of four key features within in guidance: defined words (signified by a dotted underlines), footnotes (signified by a superscript number), links to discussion boards (signified by an icon), and drop down content (signified by a chevron icon). I pointed to an example of each and asked participants what they expected to happen if they clicked on it.</p>
<p>This marked the end of the first interview session. I then explained the plus-minus and writing tasks participants needed to complete before the second session.</p>
</section>
<section id="plus-minus-task" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="plus-minus-task">Plus-Minus task:</h4>
<p>In their review of methods to solicit text evaluations from readers, de Jong and Schellens <span class="citation" data-cites="dejongReaderFocusedTextEvaluation1997">[<a href="#ref-dejongReaderFocusedTextEvaluation1997" role="doc-biblioref">12</a>]</span> distinguish between evaluation goals: selection (whether readers will engage with the text), comprehension, application (being able to apply information in a real world setting), acceptance (including credibility), appreciation, and relevance and completeness. I was not interested in selection (participants had no option other than to engage with the text), and my study scope did not extend to SRQR’s relevence nor completeness. Instead, I was interested in participant’s experience of the design decisions I had taken in presenting the SRQR guideline, including the layout, structure, optional content, definitions, and tone of voice.</p>
<p>de Jong and Schellens describe methods to target comprehension, acceptance, appreciation in isolation, but because my interest included all three, I chose a nonspecific method, the Plus-Minus task. In this task, readers are asked to annotate a document with plus and minus signs to signify positive and negative reading experiences and then discuss annotations retrospectively.</p>
<p>I asked participants to select and annotate 2 or 3 reporting items relevant to whatever they happened to writing-up in the time between interviews. I created duplicates of the SRQR guidance page and gave participants unique URLs so they did not see each other’s annotations. I used a web annotation tool called Hypothes.is #REF. Participants could optionally add comments. Participants explained their annotations in the second interview.</p>
<p>As de Jong and Schellens note <span class="citation" data-cites="dejongReaderFocusedTextEvaluation1997">[<a href="#ref-dejongReaderFocusedTextEvaluation1997" role="doc-biblioref">12</a>]</span>, the plus-minus method is advantageous over other nonspecific methods (reading think aloud #REF, and signalled stopping technique #REF) because it collect data without disturbing participants’ natural reading process. Additionally, it was useful in this study as participants could make annotations in their own time, as part of their normal work pattern.</p>
<p>Although the plus-minus task will detect text that participants consider incomprehensible, it cannot detect whether participants comprehend guidance correctly or whether they are able to apply it to their writing. To address this, I used a writing evaluation.</p>
</section>
<section id="writing-evaluation" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="writing-evaluation">Writing Evaluation</h4>
<p>In the plus-minus task described above, I asked participants to select a few reporting items relevent to what they happened to be writing at the time. For the writing evaluation, I asked participants to send me the paragraphs they had written before our next interview. I read the excerpts and noted reporting items (and sub items) as present or missing.</p>
<p>In the second interview, inspired by Davies et al.’s SQUIRE guidelines evaluation <span class="citation" data-cites="daviesFindingsNovelApproach2016">[<a href="#ref-daviesFindingsNovelApproach2016" role="doc-biblioref">13</a>]</span>, I asked participants to identify parts of their writing pertaining to reporting items. When I considered an item (or sub item) to be missing, I asked the participant whether they had reported this information. If they felt they had, I asked them to point out where, and then explored any misinterpretations. If they had <em>not</em> reported information, I asked why.</p>
</section>
<section id="semi-structured-interview-4---closing-thoughts" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="semi-structured-interview-4---closing-thoughts">Semi-structured interview 4 - closing thoughts</h4>
<p>To end the second interview session I asked participants to describe their experience of using the reporting guideline, and to share any final thoughts.</p>
</section>
<section id="methods-explored-different-intervention-components." class="level4 page-columns page-full">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="methods-explored-different-intervention-components.">Methods explored different intervention components.</h4>
<p>Each method targeted multiple intervention components. For example, in the 5 second test, participants could only see top of the home page. The text, images, and design in this section are there to communicate what reporting guidelines are, when they can be used, and that they will benefit authors. These functions come from three intervention components defined in chapter 9:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Describe what reporting guidelines are where they are first encountered</em>,</li>
<li><em>Clarify what tasks (e.g., writing, designing, or appraising research) guidelines and resources are designed for</em>, and</li>
<li><em>Describe personal benefits and benefits to others where reporting guidelines are introduced (home page, on resources, in communications)</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Components that required participants to read text could be best explored in the plus minus-task, and I hoped the writing evaluation would reveal how participants interpreted and applied instruction. I hoped the think aloud would capture opinions on salient features, and the semi structured interviews would allow me to explore remaining, un-noticed, features.</p>
<p>I did not attempt to explore three intervention components. I did not expect participants to know about or comment on search engine optimization, especially as a large amount of optimization occurs in the website meta data and is thus invisible. Although I built the website so as to allow guideline developers to make incremental updates, I did not expect participants to comment on this either. Finally, because I did not want to edit the <em>meaning</em> of the SRQR guidelines (just its layout), I did not want to add instructions aboutwhat to report when an item was not done, could not be done, or does not apply.</p>
<p>In table <a href="#tbl-methods-for-components">Table&nbsp;2</a> I detail the intervention components I expected each method to explore. The intervention componetns are defined in chapter 9, where I also list the web elements related to each component.</p>

<p>I recorded video and audio transcriptions using Microsoft Teams. Because automatic audio transcription was not always accurate, I corrected them by rewatching the videos. I de-identified transcripts by replacing names with participant codes, before uploading them to NVivo for coding <span class="citation" data-cites="qsrinternationalptyltd.NVivo2020">[<a href="#ref-qsrinternationalptyltd.NVivo2020" role="doc-biblioref">14</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>I used my intervention ingredient table (see chapter 9) as a framework to code transcripts line by line. I did this deductively; whenever a participant said anything about a component, I coded text to that component. Because some website features implemented multiple components (for example, an image can both educate and persuade), I sometimes coded text to multiple components. In this way, I created categories of codes, and each category was an intervention component.</p>
<p>Once all transcripts were coded, I grouped my categorised codes into deficiencies. If a single component was deficient in multiple ways, I created a code group for each deficiency. If there was disagreement about a deficiency (e.g.&nbsp;some people disliked a component, but others liked it), then I created sub-groups within each deficiency. Although positive feedback did not directly address my objective of identifying deficiencies, I kept these codes because they provided context and counter-evidence to deficiencies.</p>
<p>Some participants spontaneously suggested modifications. In these instances, I coded the proposed modification and the underlying deficiency. Because some participants spontaneously shared prior experiences using reporting guidelines I coded these using my list of barriers from 7 as a framework. I decided to create new codes for any barriers not previously identified.</p>
<p>In this way, I ended up with a list of deficiencies (my primary unit of analysis), and incidental lists of barriers and possible modifications.</p>

<p>Receiving negative feedback does not always hurt me. For example, sometimes I expect negative feedback because it reflects a limitation or trade-off that I already know about. Other times negative feedback can feel like an “aha” moment, as I discover a problem I immediately understand, agree with, and can see a solution to. In contrast, when feedback feels <em>bad</em>, in my experience that is because I have misunderstood something, and my internal model of the situation is off. Although I found it easy to remain professional and neutral within the interviews, having a “thick skin” is not enough.

The number of people expressing interest, eligible, consenting, and participating and shown in <a href="#tbl-interview-recruitment">Table&nbsp;4</a>, as are the reasons for drop out. Eleven people participated. Two dropped out before the second interview, without giving a reason. Participants’ characteristics are summarized in <a href="#tbl-interview-participants">Table&nbsp;5</a> and included variety in research experience (from 1 to 10+ years), subject area, country of origin, first language, and experience in using reporting guidelines. Six participants had never heard of reporting guidelines before. One had, but did not remember which one they had used. Three participants had used a reporting guideline before, and one had used many reporting guidelines before. The first interview lasted between 45 minutes - 1.5 hours, and the second interview lasted 30-45 minutes.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="design-iterations">Design Iterations</h3>
<p>I had originally planned to finish data collection before making any changes to the website. However, the first five participants consistently mentioned similar deficiencies. After reflecting and discussing with UK EQUATOR staff, we agreed these deficiencies would likely affect many authors and diminish the website’s success, and so we decided to iterate our design.</p>
<p>Briefly, the changes we made included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Editing the text at the top of the home page for clarity and to emphasise benefits.</li>
<li>Adding images to home page to make the page more attractive and to convey meaning of accompany text.</li>
<li>Addition of publisher logos to foster trust</li>
<li>Reorganisation of the introduction to SRQR to make it appear shorter.</li>
</ul>
<p>The results below include quotes and discussion pertaining to these changes.</p>
</section>
<section id="main-findings" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="main-findings">Main findings</h3>
<p>I identified deficiencies. Table <a href="#tbl-deficiencies-by-component">Table&nbsp;6</a> shows deficiencies, quotes, and codes, for each intervention component. The table also lists seven intervention components that received no mention. Three of these were purposefully not tested, three others were perhaps too subtle, and one was about <em>removing</em> aversive stimulus, so it was good that no participants commented on the presence of ugly or judgemental design.</p>
<p>I have chosen to describe a few deficiencies in more detail, either because I deemed them important, they were frequently mentioned, or involved interactions between components.</p>
<section id="var-intervention-components.describe-what-rgs-are.title" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="var-intervention-components.describe-what-rgs-are.title">Describe what reporting guidelines are where they are first encountered</h4>
<p><em>Relevant website features: Prominent definition on home page and guideline page.</em></p>
<p><em>Barriers addressed: Researchers may not know what reporting guidelines are</em></p>
<p>Because it is important that future website visitor website visitors quickly realise that the site contains resources for <em>writing up</em> research articles, as opposed to <em>designing</em> or <em>appraising</em> studies, I used the 5 second test to explore what participants understood the website to be about upon first impression. This was the first time participants saw the website. Before then, they had no idea what it would be about.</p>
<p><strong>On immediate impression, some participants quickly realised the website was about writing, but some did not, or thought it was about methodological guidelines</strong></p>
<p>All participants realised the website was about research. Some researchers realised the website was about writing within 5 seconds:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“From what I have seen, I think probably the website should be about, uh, helping you try to discover….identify the guidelines that you will use for writing your study quickly.” (value)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“how to go about writing something” (value)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, other participants gleaned only vague understandings like “support for doing research” ((value)) or “guidelines of some sorts, I think in relation to research” ((value)), and one expected the website to be about methodological guidance:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“methodology guidelines one can use or follow when conducting research” (value)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Participants with previous experience using reporting checklists recognized that the website might be about reporting guidelines:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Well, I hadn’t seen the the guide that I’m familiar with (that is the COREQ). But I think the other guides also are like COREQ. So that’s what comes to my mind. So I think it’s a [website] where you are going to find all the checklists or the guides for all the […] final stages of the research when we are, like, writing the paper, just to […] double check that everything has been included.” (value)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“That’s the EQUATOR guidelines, so that’s… consensus… expert consensus-developed guidelines for the reporting of different research.” (value)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“[I read that] you can use reporting guidelines to try and help you [write research articles] more efficiently or quickly. And then I was thinking about, what the heck are reporting guidelines? And then I think it might be stuff like STROBE or like those checklists things or PRISMA, if you’re doing a systematic review or something. And that’s all I got” (value)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given a few more seconds to explore the website on their own (during the think aloud task), all participants realised that the guidelines were for writing and others gained more insight into what to expect from reporting guidelines.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“after reading this sentence I think you want to give me a framework, a framework about writing. Is that right?”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I think the guideline would, uh, would clearly state the different sections of the research report or the manuscript and then whatever is required under a section like maybe under methods. Like what are the nitty gritties required under method.” (value)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some participants found later, longer form descriptions more informative. Referring to content half way down the landing page, one participant said:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Why couldn’t this be further up? Why can’t that be at the top and then the that stuff here follow? Because then I’d have a better idea of what this is about.[…] I would have liked to have read this at the top and I would have known straight away what this whole website was about.” (value)</p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section id="var-intervention-components.design-trust.title" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="var-intervention-components.design-trust.title">Include design, features, and language to foster trust</h4>
<p><em>Relevant website features: Professional design. EQUATOR’s Logo remains prominent. Citation metrics are presented at the top the reporting guidance. Information about who developed the guidelines, how they developed it, and why the guidance is credible is still provided, and easily findable from the top of the guidance.</em></p>
<p><em>Barriers addressed: Researchers may not believe stated benefits</em></p>
<p>When participants talked about trust, they mentioned whether the website appeared professional, credible, and believable. This intervention component is complex because content and design throughout the entire website influenced judgements regarding trust. In particular, participants wanted to know who made the website and why they could be trusted, and identified some design elements that could look more professional.</p>
<p><strong>EQUATOR’s introduction could be more prominent</strong></p>
<p>Apart from its logo, EQUATOR is not mentioned at the top of the page. Participants who did know about EQUATOR said that its brand lent credibility:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“and then I picked up the top my top left hand corner with the EQUATOR logo so it seemed from reputable source.” (value)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I already trust the website because I saw that… like this is legit and I see the credentials from EQUATOR network” (value)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Participants unfamiliar with EQUATOR expressed wanting to know who developed the website. Whilst looking at the top of the home page, one participant said:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I really don’t get an idea of […] who’s responsible for the website […] would I trust the the developers of the website?” (value)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The EQUATOR Network is introduced towards the bottom of the home page. Participants recommended moving this introduction (or parts of it) up to the top, using an updated photo, and adding EQUATOR’s affiliations and awards.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“So most places put the the <em>about</em> stuff at the bottom and I would have liked to have seen what [EQUATOR stands for] explained right at the top.” (value)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“And then this is the thing on the bottom that I want to look at on every website… because I want to see if they have an actual office. So usually I click this”about us” first” (value)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Participant: Oh, so this is your mission. So here my question is <em>What is this group? What is EQUATOR?</em> So this is my first question because from my background, which is not from medicine, I’m not very familiar with this group. So I want to know what is this and the second feeling I have, I think I might want to see this information at the very first beginning…I want to know who this website is created by? Because I want to use a professional website, so I think the reason I read this paragraph is I want to find some evidence to prove that your group is very professional. Interviewer: Mmm. Participant: Well, maybe you can put [the section about EQUATOR] at the very first beginning and provide a little description about what the group is about, what it is, and what are those people where do they come from something like this.” (value)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I also did some research with my Chinese colleagues and sometimes some prestigious university’s logo will add trust, yeah.” (value)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I think sometimes it is useful […] to put some awards here. Just to make people think you are trustworthy.” (value)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The site’s design could be more professional</strong></p>
<p>A design intention was to make the website appear simple. The first iteration was apparently <em>too</em> simple and one participant explained how its simplicity made it less trustworthy:</p>
<p>“it looks kind of like a blog […] it’s a basic website” (value)</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t say [it looks] partically trustworthy, but not particularly suspicious either. Kind of in the middle […] something that will be more trustworthy will be something which is more sophisticated because I know, ‘OK, this is someone who actually took his time to do a lot of work… put a lot of work in designing it’. Most of the time if it is a fake website, it’s usually much more simple.” (value)</p>
<p>One participant viewed both the first and second iterations of the home page (their second interview session occurred after the iteration), and they described the second iteration as better because “It’s like more trustable […] Scientific. Evidence based. Yeah, of course, legit.” Others decribed the second iteration as “clean” and “uncluttered” (value), “straightforward” and “open” (value), and even as “calming” (value).</p>
<p>However, one participant still questioned the second iteration simplicity and trustworthiness, and drew a comparison with another website that she <em>did</em> trust:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“So I’m saying it’s kind of basic, that the format itself is kind of basic […] [When] I’m looking for information on PUB Med, just the outlet itself gives you the picture that, you know, somehow you can trust it. You know it looks as if there was more work put in it.” (value)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Logos lend credibility and could be more prominent</strong></p>
<p>Participants noticed that the first iteration had no logos:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I don’t know if this is just me, but I kinda want some logos. So I know who will vouch for [the website] right away. Like, usually […] there’s some, like, other medical societies that are, like,”We we are on the EQUATOR network” (value)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Inspired by these comments, we added logos to the second iteration home page to show publishers endorsing reporting guidelines. All participants liked these, but some suggested they could appear at the top of the home page so they are immediately visible.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Leading publishers….Wow, this is good…Nature. Really? Elsevier, BMJ. Yes, this is good. And this brings some sense of trust and authenticity in the website.” (value)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“[The publishers’ logos are] encouraging, because these are all publishing houses with mostly reputable journals, probably all reputable journals. […] You know, if these were higher up, then […] that would have made me feel a little bit more like ohh, this is good.” (value)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Reporting guideline endorsements and citations lend credibility, but may not be intuitive</strong></p>
<p>The top of the SRQR guideline page included widgets displaying the number of journal endorsements, and the number of times the reporting guideline had been cited. Some people commented that this information lent credibility:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I think it is authentic. It’s robust. If it was endorsed by many journals and developed by experienced researchers, if I use it, maybe I’ll get a better quality work.” (value)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I think citations here might be some people or some people’s work who has cited this page. So this this button […] might show people how many other words use this page.” (value)”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“…understand […] that the SRQR guidelines is something that’s already widely used.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I didn’t pay attention before, but I think I like it (the citation information) […] if it is more cited, I think, like, I will believe it. I will believe it, like, much better, and also like the journal endorsements” (value)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, not everybody understood what these numbers meant.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Is this [widget] telling me [something], or is it what I am supposed to click on?” (value)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I was a bit confused there, OK” (value)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I think the citation tab over here… What is the relevance of it? I mean, why I’m seeing that?” (value)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Others were not sure whether the citation information pertained to the website or an underlying article.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I’m not sure if [it is about], you know, the website or connected paper.” (value)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Has it been cited 4000 times? I don’t understand that.” (value)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Not everybody considered the image at the top of the home page to be trustworthy</strong></p>
<p>For the second iteration, I added an image to the top of the home page comprising of three icons to represent the process of writing a manuscript. On participant described this image as a “bit naff […] I actually think this [image] reduces [the website’s] score on the first impressions of trustworthiness kind of thing. Just because [the icons making up the image] are so, umm, ubiquitous, and, uh cheap?” (value)</p>
</section>
<section id="var-intervention-components.describe-benefits.title" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="var-intervention-components.describe-benefits.title">Describe personal benefits and benefits to others where reporting guidelines are introduced (home page, on resources, in communications)</h4>
<p><em>Relevant website features: Benefits are prominently and consistently displayed across the home page and guidance pages. Descriptions prioritize personal benefits to the authors above hypothetical benefits to others.</em></p>
<p><em>Barriers addressed: Researchers may not know what benefits to expect</em></p>
<p><strong>Benefits are clear, but could be communicated quicker</strong></p>
<p>We wanted website visitors to immediately expect the website to benefit them as researchers and authors. The website headline is one of the first things visitors see, and so was an important feature for communicating benefits. In the first iteration the heading was <em>“Research articles, made simple”</em>, but participants thought this was about <em>reading</em> or <em>explaining</em> research articles. In the second iteration, we changed this heading to <em>“Want help writing up research?”</em>.</p>
<p>All participants talked about benefits or help. None talked about the opposite (e.g., rules, requirements, or red tape). In the 5 second test, some of these descriptions were vague:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I see research and writing. So i’m thinking. This is to help me with something with my job.” (value)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“so it’s going to assist me in research. It’s going to help me somehow. Make things easier for me.” (value)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under the headline, we included a short statement: <em>‘reporting guidelines help you describe research quickly, confidently in completely’</em>. Two participants did not find this brief text meaningful in the five second test:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I tried to read the sub headline just below the biggest one and it says help you blah blah confidently and blah blah. […] So I think this information maybe be meaningless for me […] because it sounds like it didn’t provide some concrete information. It’s just a sentence that tried to cheer me up.” (value)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“And then there’s something to do with <em>‘reporting guidelines help you describe research quickly, confidently in completely’</em>. This information is not really telling me much” (value)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, they seemed to understand the reported benefits after reading the top of the home page in more detail, and after vieweing the section below where benefits are stated more clearly (e.g.,). Similarly, other participants began to understand the benefits and link them to their own experiences as authors.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“OK, I think this part is very great because when I when I see something like <em>”easy writing”</em>, <em>”smoother publishing”</em> I think <em>”Ohh, that’s great. That’s what I want.”</em>” (value)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Participant: Now I’m getting a sense of what the website is about. Now looking at the things down here…</p>
<p>Interviewer: OK.</p>
<p>Participant: I’m getting that might be a useful resource. That actually, umm, because these areas I think for… early career researchers like me, I’d say I’d be very interested to come in and see this.” (value)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Participants seemed to understand how reporting guidelines might make publishing “smoother”.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“it gives me an impression that maybe this website will help me write my work easily and it will also help me increase the chance of my work getting published” - (value)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Umm, just aligning myself to this standard that already many people use. And hopefully, In doing that, I’ll be up to standard and then I won’t stress myself too much later.” (value)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Making a distinction between benefits to authors and readers may lead to confusion about the intended user</strong></p>
<p>Further down the home page, the section title <em>‘Helping authors and readers’</em> made one participant expect the website to also host resources for readers.</p>
<p>“So this is a bit weird. So is the point here that this one is for the writers. And now it’s saying, OK, but we can also help readers. OK, I suppose that’s interesting.” PPT-CW</p>
<p><strong>The images depicting benefits could be clearer</strong></p>
<p>One participant said the icons describing writing and impact were appropriate (a blank page and an award, respectively), but the image depicting “smoother publishing” was not intuitive.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“looking at that icon, it doesn’t really tell me anything about smoother [publishing].” (value)</p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section id="var-intervention-components.clarify-tasks.title" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="var-intervention-components.clarify-tasks.title">Clarify what tasks (e.g., writing, designing, or appraising research) guidelines and resources are designed for</h4>
<p><em>Relevant website features: Clear instruction and differentiation of resources</em></p>
<p><em>Barriers addressed: Researchers may not know what reporting guidelines are; Researchers may not know when reporting guidelines should be used</em></p>
<p><strong>Tools for drafting and checking were mostly intuitive, but could be more prominent.</strong></p>
<p>The home page included a section describing how templates and checklists could be used to draft and check manuscripts. Participants seemed to find these intuitive and appealing:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I like that: different stages and different tools” (value)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Yeah, writing templates is something I’ve recently come across, and I think that might be useful. I’ve tried it a bit when writing abstracts. And I guess, yeah, that would be something I’d be interested in looking into further.” (value)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even though participants could not download templates or checklists, they had expectations of what these resources might look like.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“The checklist could be a pre-populated document that I can go through..it may have a table that I could go through as a tick box exercise ticking which of the [guideline reporting items] my study includes.” (value)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“[Regarding templates] I would like to adjust this template by myself. Just like a semi structured interview. I don’t want this template be a structured interview. I want it to be semi structured so I can have the space to adjust it.” (value)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Putting this information further up the page might help visitors “get” what RGs are about</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“would actually be very good to appear [higher up the page] because then it would now start opening up one’s understanding as to exactly where this kind of guidelines might be applied.” (value)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“If any of these things: <em>writing research</em>, <em>checking manuscripts</em> and <em>planning research</em>, if these can be consolidated on [the top of] your landing page somewhere […] it might might be beneficial because my thought process is that I need to know what I’m doing and only then reporting guidelines can help me, right? So if I know that this website gonna help me with writing the manuscripts, checking […] I think then, reporting guidelines can make a logical progression in that particular case?” (value)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Using a reporting guideline “for planning” was not intuitive</strong></p>
<p>The home page instructed that reporting guidelines can be used when planning research, but will not dictate design decisions. The SRQR page had a button to download a “log book” where researchers could document the decisions and data they would later need to report. However, no participants understood what this log book might be:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“it’s not immediately intuitive what a log book might be” (value)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“OK, what’s a log book? Don’t know.” (value)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“nothing has been mentioned about the log book overhead. How [am I] gonna use the log book? Maybe you have mentioned about the template checklist, but uh, maybe we can add [something about] the log book.” (value)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The word “planning” was not intuitive either. One thought this meant planning a manuscript, and so confused the purpose of the log book with that of the template. Another interpreted it as guidance for writing a research proposal.</p>

<p>I had ordered the tasks and tools as “drafting”, “checking” and then “planning”. I put planning at the end because it is the least conventional way to use a reporting guidelines. Some participants questioned this ordering:</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="var-intervention-components.examples.title">For each item, provide examples of reporting in different contexts</h4>
<p><strong>Many participants said they wanted more, varied examples</strong></p>
<p>Each reporting item in SRQR comes with one or more examples from published literature. All participants stressed the usefulness of these examples. The attention examples received was notable because I did not ask about them; all comments about examples came spontaneously from the participant in the think aloud and plus minus tasks.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Oh, and you have examples that could be really helpful, yeah.” (value)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“the most important thing I would say is the examples” (value)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I found [this section] very useful as they give more detailed explanations on each specific section, and particularly the examples.” (value)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, many participants said they wanted more examples, and greater variation in style, length, and conciseness.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“need further explanation and examples” (value)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“it would would have been useful or helpful for me to to have more than just one example.” (value)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“illustrations of how to [report] this information in a concise manner, that would be very helpful as well.” (value)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“you may as well put a whole discussion in there, or at least just sort of three or four paragraph discussion” (value)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“And here if there could be more examples, because when I […] started to read through and understand the the PRISMA guidelines and use the official explanation file to try to understand exactly what I’m required to write about and the examples particularly helped me a lot.” (value)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many participants wanted examples from their own field, or even entire publications that have used the guideline:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“So I want something more relatable, [because] when I was reading these examples they were not relevant to my work.” (value)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“…if you can list some […] papers who use the SRQR, you can put it here.” (value)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I’ve searched and pubmed to find an example of a research article that’s used these standards so I could copy or check how they’ve laid it out, which subheadings they’ve used.” (value)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Citations may be less credible if they are old or not referenced</strong></p>
<p>In the original SRQR publication, all examples are referenced. I had not included references for the examples when putting them onto the website because of time constraints. This bothered one participant.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Well, there’s no references there, so is that a very good example? No, I don’t know the source of these things. […] You know, I don’t know, where did it come from? Where’s the reference?” (value)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I asked about hypothetically labelling examples as fake if they were made up, the participant said “Yeah, I guess that would be alright”.</p>
<p>The same participant also noted that an example was quite old (10 years).</p>
<p><strong>Citations could be more useful if explained or annotated</strong></p>
<p>Because some reporting items contain multiple sub-items, one participant said annotating examples may be helpful. Taking a discussion item about transferability and integrating findings, they suggested “if you could underline or maybe indicate [in the example] that <em>this</em> [sentence] is now how they are trying to say the result can be transferable, umm, this is another [sentence] trying to say how they’re trying to integrate…. something like that.” (value)</p>

<p>Some complex words in the redesigned SRQR guideline had blue dotted lines underneath. When participants clicked them, a definition would pop up. Participants stressed usefulness of this feature, and everybody liked that the definitions appeared in a popup, and not on a new page.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“One feature that I really found to be very useful was where you [described] different kind of kinds of terms there […] When I’m not quite sure about the term there was. If I clicked on it, there was a description and that was very clearly written out and it made it quite easy to use the information that was there.” (value)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Participants wanted more definitions within the guidance (some struggled with words like “transferability” or “generalizability”) and other areas of the website. For example, when reading about the scope of SRQR and related guidelines, participants struggled to understand terms like “qualitative evidence synthesis”</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“A qualitative evidence synthesis. What’s that? Is that like a review?” (value)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When reading a list of guidelines for different study types on the home page, one participant explained how not understanding terms like “cohort study” led her to feel anxious and worried.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Actually, I feel a little anxious because I’m not sure whether it shows that I am not good at something or I am ignorant or something. So when I saw all of these and, like half of them, I didn’t know. I may feel anxious and maybe, like, lose confidence sometimes.” (value)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>User experience might be clearer if definitions were signified by a different colour (not blue)</strong></p>
<p>Because I wanted to know whether future users would discover this functionality by themselves, I asked participants what they expected the dotted lines to signify. Most participants guessed correctly.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Interviewer: Like what do you expect those dotted lines to mean? Participant: Umm, I think dotted lines would mean that it will give me a definition.” (value)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“It’s not exactly a hyperlink, but it might give you a definition or something like that” (value)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, a couple of participants thought the lines might signify hyperlinks, and another thought it was a misspelt word because it looked like Microsoft Word’s autocorrect feature.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I’m honestly not sure whether I see just a highlight or it’s a link. Or what it is Usually links are in blue completely in blue.” (value)</p>

<p><em>Barriers addressed: Researchers may expect the costs to outweigh benefits</em></p></td>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I find the guideline more interactive than simply, you know, a PDF document. So I really appreciate that it was more structured and the guide was more easy to follow.

<p><strong>Participants liked having extra content as notes, but footnotes might not be optimal implementation</strong></p>
<p>When an SRQR item contained extra context or explanation not relevant to all users, I moved this into a note. I wa not sure of the best way to implement notes.</p>
<p>I tried footnotes, but participants expected the footnote identifiers (superscript numbers) to be references, and did not like how reading the footnote took them to the bottom of the page, away from where they had been reading:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I think it’s a citation. So uh linked to a reference. But I think it may also be foot note.” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“[Superscript numbers are] always a link to, like, a reference. If not a reference like some…[clicks it]…okay, so it’s telling me things. It’s probably not a reference like in Wikipedia. It shows you it’s a link. This one is telling me more things. So it’s a footnote.” </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I worked hard to scroll down. I’m not gonna go back up. So, whatever, i’m not reading [it].” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Menu navigation was useful but could be more prominent and go one level deeper</strong></p>
<p>The redesigned SRQR guideline has a side navigation menu so users can easily navigate to the Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion guidance sections, or to the FAQs and citation information. A few participants did not notice the menu, or suggested it could be more prominent, and one suggested it would be useful if the menu listed all reporting items.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“when I scrolling I forgot to pay attention to the menu on the side. So […] I suddenly realized it was a menu there […] Maybe make it much more, like, the characters larger or, like, the colour, maybe change it, because now it is so light and I didn’t pay attention to that. But this menu is useful if I pay attention to this.” (value)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each reporting item has its own menu so users can jump to the item’s justification, examples, or related resources. The same participant described these item menus as a useful way to help “find the detailed part” they desired.</p>
<p><strong>Section URLs could be more intuitive</strong></p>
<p>When the mouse hovers above a reporting item heading, a button would appear to allow users to a copy the URL to that specific section. One participant did not find this intuitive, and thought the button would take them to more information instead.</p>
<p><strong>Participants may desire a summary of the guidance</strong></p>
<p>In the think aloud, one participant said they would prefer to browse the checklist above the full guidance because “in my head, like the checklist probably has these things already” (value), and expected the checklist to act as a summary. This expectation may explain why another participant said “I just want to see what this thing is and at the moment I don’t know. Should I read the guidelines or checklist?”, perhaps because they desired an overview (value).</p>
<p>“So maybe not the full guideline, but I’m not sure how how you can present it. Maybe one paragraph, or, uh, or you could present a mind map. Maybe you can present a mind map and you can put the keywords of this guideline. So if people want to see, for example, […] introduction, literature review, methodology, blah blah. Something like this.” (value)</p>
<p><strong>Participants found item titles hard to spot when scrolling</strong></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“The names of the sections are, like, black and a little plain. So I think […] the name of each section should be somehow highlighted” (value)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“And they don’t really stand out in my opinion, like, just about the layout of the page themself. You see, this [heading] doesn’t stand out so much from the rest, just the font is a little bigger. For example, if I’m scrolling through it very fast, it may be I might miss it. So if those headings or subheadings could be made more visible…” (value)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Some participants did not expect / want all guidance on one page</strong></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I didn’t expect it to be part of the same page because, just looking at the side [menu] here, it makes it a very long page to scroll through. So I guess what I’m a bit more familiar with is, you know, you click on something, it takes you to the guidance and then each of [the items] might be on a separate page […] So it’s less of a scroll and more of a click.” (value)</p>

<td><p><strong>The relationship between the website and publication could be clearer</strong></p>
<p>The top of the guideline page references the original SRQR publication.

<p>The FAQs helped clear up this relationship, and some participants recommended they be signposted (or briefly explained) at the top of the guidance page.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“[The FAQ section about development] gave me more information about how [the guideline] came about. You know, I was asking [for] that when we first spoke, and here it was.

<p>Participants naturally discussed barriers and facilitators they encountered when applying guidance, either during this study or in their previous experience. These factors were external to the website being tested, and I had identified many of them in my previous work (chapters . Participants mentioned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not having known what reporting guidelines were earlier in their career</li>
<li>Feeling frustrated when asked to use a reporting guideline or checklist when they have already finalised their manuscript and are submitting to a journal.</li>
<li>(Previously) finding the checklist, but not the full guidance</li>
<li>Being limited by journal requirements and word limits</li>
<li>Struggling to keep writing concise and fluid</li>
<li>Needing more guidance</li>
<li>Being unable to report an item because it is their colleague’s responsibility, or because they hadn’t done what was being asked when designing their study or collecting data.</li>
<li>Paywalls</li>
<li>Using reporting guidelines for teaching students</li>
<li>Wanting guidance for funding applications</li>
<li>Funders enforcing reporting guidelines</li>
</ul>
<p>Participants also mentioned barriers I had not identified previously. These included:</p>
<ul>
<li>When guideline author names appear Western, some (non western) participants expected the guidance to be less relevant to them.</li>
<li>Describing a guideline as “version 1.0” might make people feel like the guidance is (too) new, and therefore less trustable.</li>
<li>The loading speed of websites (thankfully, this was not an issue for the website being tested)</li>
<li>Not understanding reviewer feedback</li>
<li>Not wanting to read on a screen</li>
<li>Not understanding the relationship between the EQUATOR Network and the guidelines or guideline developers.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="comparisons-between-the-website-being-tested-and-the-old-equator-website-guideline-publications.">Comparisons between the website being tested and the old EQUATOR website &amp; guideline publications.</h4>
<p>A few participants ended up exploring the <em>original</em> EQUATOR website and the <em>original</em> SRQR publication during their interviews. Participant’s drove these unplanned explorations and comparisons. One wanted to retrace their steps to show me the guideline they had used previously. Two others wanted to continue using reporting guidelines in the future and asked me where the original SRQR guidance could be found. Some others spontaneously reflected on their previous experience.</p>
<p>Recounting their experience of seeing the original EQUATOR website for the first time between interview sessions, one participant (value) said “Ohh no I didn’t like it. The [new] one is much, much better” because it looked more “trustworthy, more organised” and they preferred the font and colours. Another participant described the original website as “boring”, “outdated” and “text heavy” before recounting their experience of using it:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Not that long ago I went on to the site because I was looking to complete a reporting checklist and it seemed clear to find the checklist that I wanted. But when I went through the checklist, it wasn’t appropriate. And then I just ended up feeling a bit unsure about what it is, which was the best one to go for.” (value)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I witnessed another participant (value) experience similar confusion. They wanted to find the original SRQR guidance to continue using it after the study finished. Sharing their screen and thinking aloud, they started on the EQUATOR Network home page and tried to find the original SRQR guidance without my help. Although at first they thought EQUATOR’s home page looked “full” and “rich”, they were quickly “confused” by both EQUATOR’s website and the SRQR publication. After eight minutes and giving up three times, they eventually found the checklist but not the supplement containing the full guidance.</p>
<p>A second participant (value) achieved the same outcome a few minutes faster. Because examples only appear in the full guidance (which they hadn’t found) they instead looked through “the reference list to see if there was potentially an example paper” and then planned to “go back to PubMed and search for an article that used these guidelines”. The participant appeared to have little interest in the article’s text, saying they did not “care what [the guideline developers] did to come up with it”.</p>
<p>Another participant (value) echoed this opinion when comparing the original SRQR publication with the redesigned version. They said they “don’t need” to know how SRQR was made when they are trying to use it, and they felt the redesigned guidance is “a bit more precise and to the point”. When I showed them the original SRQR full guidance (the supplement), they said:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Participant: That’s too heavy on the content.</p>
<p>Interviewer: So if if the option was between this this version that you’re looking at now [the supplement] and the the website that you saw first, which do you think you prefer to use?</p>
<p>Participant: I think [the website] is far better than the [supplement]. Yeah, this one [the website] is far better.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another participant reflected on their previous experience of using the PRISMA guidelines and explanation document. They said:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I rather prefer this form [the website] of guidance than the other one. There can be a lot more information that are being presented in this way. […] That’s better because it it’s more (how can I say?) well presented, well laid out, so that where I need to go deeper, I can go easily. Where I need just surface information or the parts that I’m already familiar with, I can just scroll through […] So I think I’ll prefer something presented in this way than the than the document that I read” (value).</p>

## Results

### Recruitment

I recruited participants between 21/03/2023 until 9/08/2023. The number of people expressing interest, eligible, consenting, and participating and shown in @tbl-interview-recruitment, as are the reasons for drop out. Eleven people participated. Two dropped out before the second interview, without giving a reason. Participants' characteristics are summarized in @tbl-interview-participants and included variety in research experience (from 1 to 10+ years), subject area, country of origin, first language, and experience in using reporting guidelines. Six participants had never heard of reporting guidelines before. One had, but did not remember which one they had used. Three participants had used a reporting guideline before, and one had used many reporting guidelines before. The first interview lasted between 45 minutes - 1.5 hours, and the second interview lasted 30-45 minutes.

### Design Iterations

I had originally planned to finish data collection before making any changes to the website. However, the first five participants consistently mentioned similar deficiencies. After reflecting and discussing with UK EQUATOR staff, we agreed these deficiencies would likely affect many authors and diminish the website's success, and so we decided to iterate our design.

Briefly, the changes we made included:

-   Editing the text at the top of the home page for clarity and to emphasise benefits.
-   Adding images to home page to make the page more attractive and to convey meaning of accompany text.
-   Addition of publisher logos to foster trust
-   Reorganisation of the introduction to SRQR to make it appear shorter.

The results below include quotes and discussion pertaining to these changes.

### Main findings

I identified {{< var.counts.pilot.deficiencies >}} deficiencies. Table @tbl-deficiencies-by-component shows deficiencies, quotes, and codes, for each intervention component. The table also lists seven intervention components that received no mention. Three of these were purposefully not tested, three others were perhaps too subtle, and one was about _removing_ aversive stimulus, so it was good that no participants commented on the presence of ugly or judgemental design.

I have chosen to describe a few deficiencies in more detail, either because I deemed them important, they were frequently mentioned, or involved interactions between components.

#### Describe what reporting guidelines are where they are first encountered

_Relevant website features: Prominent definition on home page and guideline page._

_Barriers addressed: Researchers may not know what reporting guidelines are_

Because it is important that future website visitor website visitors quickly realise that the site contains resources for _writing up_ research articles, as opposed to _designing_ or _appraising_ studies, I used the 5 second test to explore what participants understood the website to be about upon first impression. This was the first time participants saw the website. Before then, they had no idea what it would be about.

**On immediate impression, some participants quickly realised the website was about writing, but some did not, or thought it was about methodological guidelines**

All participants realised the website was about research. Some researchers realised the website was about writing within 5 seconds: 

> "From what I have seen, I think probably the website should be about, uh, helping you try to discover....identify the guidelines that you will use for writing your study quickly." (value)

> "how to go about writing something" (value)

However, other participants gleaned only vague understandings like "support for doing research" ((value)) or "guidelines of some sorts, I think in relation to research" ((value)), and one expected the website to be about methodological guidance:

> "methodology guidelines one can use or follow when conducting research" (value)

Participants with previous experience using reporting checklists recognized that the website might be about reporting guidelines:

> "Well, I hadn't seen the the guide that I'm familiar with (that is the COREQ). But I think the other guides also are like COREQ. So that's what comes to my mind. So I think it's a [website] where you are going to find all the checklists or the guides for all the [...] final stages of the research when we are, like, writing the paper, just to [...] double check that everything has been included." (value)

> "That's the EQUATOR guidelines, so that's... consensus... expert consensus-developed guidelines for the reporting of different research." (value)

> "[I read that] you can use reporting guidelines to try and help you [write research articles] more efficiently or quickly. And then I was thinking about, what the heck are reporting guidelines? And then I think it might be stuff like STROBE or like those checklists things or PRISMA, if you're doing a systematic review or something. And that's all I got" (value)

Given a few more seconds to explore the website on their own (during the think aloud task), all participants realised that the guidelines were for writing and others gained more insight into what to expect from reporting guidelines.

> "after reading this sentence I think you want to give me a framework, a framework about writing. Is that right?"

> "I think the guideline would, uh, would clearly state the different sections of the research report or the manuscript and then whatever is required under a section like maybe under methods. Like what are the nitty gritties required under method." (value)

Some participants found later, longer form descriptions more informative. Referring to content half way down the landing page, one participant said: 

> "Why couldn't this be further up? Why can't that be at the top and then the that stuff here follow? Because then I'd have a better idea of what this is about.[...] I would have liked to have read this at the top and I would have known straight away what this whole website was about." (value)




#### Include design, features, and language to foster trust

_Relevant website features: Professional design. EQUATOR’s Logo remains prominent. Citation metrics are presented at the top the reporting guidance. Information about who developed the guidelines, how they developed it, and why the guidance is credible is still provided, and easily findable from the top of the guidance._

_Barriers addressed: Researchers may not believe stated benefits_

When participants talked about trust, they mentioned whether the website appeared professional, credible, and believable. This intervention component is complex because content and design throughout the entire website influenced judgements regarding trust. In particular, participants wanted to know who made the website and why they could be trusted, and identified some design elements that could look more professional. 

**EQUATOR's introduction could be more prominent**

Apart from its logo, EQUATOR is not mentioned at the top of the page. Participants who did know about EQUATOR said that its brand lent credibility: 

> "and then I picked up the top my top left hand corner with the EQUATOR logo so it seemed from reputable source." (value)

> "I already trust the website because I saw that... like this is legit and I see the credentials from EQUATOR network" (value)

Participants unfamiliar with EQUATOR expressed wanting to know who developed the website. Whilst looking at the top of the home page, one participant said:

> "I really don't get an idea of [...] who's responsible for the website [...] would I trust the the developers of the website?" (value)

The EQUATOR Network is introduced towards the bottom of the home page. Participants recommended moving this introduction (or parts of it) up to the top, using an updated photo, and adding EQUATOR's affiliations and awards. 

> "So most places put the the _about_ stuff at the bottom and I would have liked to have seen what [EQUATOR stands for] explained right at the top." (value)

> "And then this is the thing on the bottom that I want to look at on every website... because I want to see if they have an actual office. So usually I click this "about us" first" (value)

> "Participant: Oh, so this is your mission. So here my question is _What is this group? What is EQUATOR?_ So this is my first question because from my background, which is not from medicine, I'm not very familiar with this group. So I want to know what is this and the second feeling I have, I think I might want to see this information at the very first beginning...I want to know who this website is created by? Because I want to use a professional website, so I think the reason I read this paragraph is I want to find some evidence to prove that your group is very professional.
> Interviewer: Mmm.
> Participant: Well, maybe you can put [the section about EQUATOR] at the very first beginning and provide a little description about what the group is about, what it is, and what are those people where do they come from something like this." (value)

> "I also did some research with my Chinese colleagues and sometimes some prestigious university's logo will add trust, yeah." (value)

> "I think sometimes it is useful [...] to put some awards here. Just to make people think you are trustworthy." (value)

**The site's design could be more professional**

A design intention was to make the website appear simple. The first iteration was apparently _too_ simple and one participant explained how its simplicity made it less trustworthy:

"it looks kind of like a blog [...] it's a basic website" (value)

"I wouldn't say [it looks] partically trustworthy, but not particularly suspicious either. Kind of in the middle [...] something that will be more trustworthy will be something which is more sophisticated because I know, 'OK, this is someone who actually took his time to do a lot of work... put a lot of work in designing it'. Most of the time if it is a fake website, it's usually much more simple." (value)

One participant viewed both the first and second iterations of the home page (their second interview session occurred after the iteration), and they described the second iteration as better because "It's like more trustable [...] Scientific. Evidence based. Yeah, of course, legit." Others decribed the second iteration as "clean" and "uncluttered" (value), "straightforward" and "open" (value), and even as "calming" (value).

However, one participant still questioned the second iteration simplicity and trustworthiness, and drew a comparison with another website that she _did_ trust:

> "So I'm saying it's kind of basic, that the format itself is kind of basic [...] [When] I'm looking for information on PUB Med, just the outlet itself gives you the picture that, you know, somehow you can trust it. You know it looks as if there was more work put in it." (value)

**Logos lend credibility and could be more prominent**

Participants noticed that the first iteration had no logos:

> "I don't know if this is just me, but I kinda want some logos. So I know who will
vouch for [the website] right away. Like, usually [...] there's some, like, other medical societies that are, like, "We we are on the EQUATOR network" (value)

Inspired by these comments, we added logos to the second iteration home page to show publishers endorsing reporting guidelines. All participants liked these, but some suggested they could appear at the top of the home page so they are immediately visible.

> "Leading publishers....Wow, this is good...Nature. Really? Elsevier, BMJ. Yes, this is good. And this brings some sense of trust and authenticity in the website." (value)

> "[The publishers' logos are] encouraging, because these are all publishing houses with mostly reputable journals, probably all reputable journals. [...] You know, if these were higher up, then [...] that would have made me feel a little bit more like ohh, this is good." (value)

**Reporting guideline endorsements and citations lend credibility, but may not be intuitive**

The top of the SRQR guideline page included widgets displaying the number of journal endorsements, and the number of times the reporting guideline had been cited. Some people commented that this information lent credibility: 

> "I think it is authentic. It's robust. If it was endorsed by many journals and developed by experienced researchers, if I use it, maybe I'll get a better quality work." (value)

> "I think citations here might be some people or some people's work who has cited this page. So this this button [...] might show people how many other words use this page." (value)"

> "...understand [...] that the SRQR guidelines is something that's already widely used."

> "I didn't pay attention before, but I think I like it (the citation information) [...] if it is more cited, I think, like, I will believe it. I will believe it, like, much better, and also like the journal endorsements" (value)

However, not everybody understood what these numbers meant.

> "Is this [widget] telling me [something], or is it what I am supposed to click on?" (value)

> "I was a bit confused there, OK" (value)

> "I think the citation tab over here... What is the relevance of it? I mean, why I'm seeing that?" (value)

Others were not sure whether the citation information pertained to the website or an underlying article. 

> "I'm not sure if [it is about], you know, the website or connected paper." (value)

> "Has it been cited 4000 times? I don't understand that." (value)

**Not everybody considered the image at the top of the home page to be trustworthy**

For the second iteration, I added an image to the top of the home page comprising of three icons to represent the process of writing a manuscript. On participant described this image as a "bit naff [...] I actually think this [image] reduces [the website's] score on the first impressions of trustworthiness kind of thing. Just because [the icons making up the image] are so, umm, ubiquitous, and, uh cheap?" (value)



#### Describe personal benefits and benefits to others where reporting guidelines are introduced (home page, on resources, in communications)

_Relevant website features: Benefits are prominently and consistently displayed across the home page and guidance pages. Descriptions prioritize personal benefits to the authors above hypothetical benefits to others._

_Barriers addressed: Researchers may not know what benefits to expect_


**Benefits are clear, but could be communicated quicker**

We wanted website visitors to immediately expect the website to benefit them as researchers and authors. The website headline is one of the first things visitors see, and so was an important feature for communicating benefits. In the first iteration the heading was _"Research articles, made simple"_, but participants thought this was about _reading_ or _explaining_ research articles. In the second iteration, we changed this heading to _"Want help writing up research?"_. 

All participants talked about benefits or help. None talked about the opposite (e.g., rules, requirements, or red tape). In the 5 second test, some of these descriptions were vague:

> "I see research and writing. So i'm thinking. This is to help me with something with my job." (value)

> "so it's going to assist me in research. It's going to help me somehow. Make things easier for me." (value)

Under the headline, we included a short statement: _'reporting guidelines help you describe research quickly, confidently in completely'_. Two participants did not find this brief text meaningful in the five second test:

> "I tried to read the sub headline just below the biggest one and it says help you blah blah confidently and blah blah. [...] So I think this information maybe be meaningless for me [...] because it sounds like it didn't provide some concrete information. It's just a sentence that tried to cheer me up." (value)

> "And then there's something to do with _'reporting guidelines help you describe research quickly, confidently in completely'_. This information is not really telling me much" (value)

However, they seemed to understand the reported benefits after reading the top of the home page in more detail, and after vieweing the section below where benefits are stated more clearly (e.g.,). Similarly, other participants began to understand the benefits and link them to their own experiences as authors. 

> "OK, I think this part is very great because when I when I see something like _"easy writing"_, _"smoother publishing"_ I think _"Ohh, that's great. That's what I want."_" (value)

> "Participant: Now I'm getting a sense of what the website is about. Now looking at the things down here...
>
> Interviewer: OK.
>
> Participant: I'm getting that might be a useful resource. That actually, umm, because these areas I think for... early career researchers like me, I'd say I'd be very interested to come in and see this." (value)

Participants seemed to understand how reporting guidelines might make publishing "smoother". 

> "it gives me an impression that maybe this website will help me write my work easily and it will also help me increase the chance of my work getting published" - (value)

> "Umm, just aligning myself to this standard that already many people use. And hopefully, In doing that, I'll be up to standard and then I won't stress myself too much later." (value)

**Making a distinction between benefits to authors and readers may lead to confusion about the intended user**

Further down the home page, the section title _'Helping authors and readers'_ made one participant expect the website to also host resources for readers.

"So this is a bit weird. So is the point here that this one is for the writers. And now it's saying, OK, but we can also help readers. OK, I suppose that's interesting." PPT-CW

**The images depicting benefits could be clearer**

One participant said the icons describing writing and impact were appropriate (a blank page and an award, respectively), but the image depicting "smoother publishing" was not intuitive. 

> "looking at that icon, it doesn't really tell me anything about smoother [publishing]." (value)






#### Clarify what tasks (e.g., writing, designing, or appraising research) guidelines and resources are designed for

_Relevant website features: Clear instruction and differentiation of resources_

_Barriers addressed: Researchers may not know what reporting guidelines are; Researchers may not know when reporting guidelines should be used_

**Tools for drafting and checking were mostly intuitive, but could be more prominent.**

The home page included a section describing how templates and checklists could be used to draft and check manuscripts. Participants seemed to find these intuitive and appealing:

> "I like that: different stages and different tools" (value)

> "Yeah, writing templates is something I've recently come across, and I think that might be useful. I've tried it a bit when writing abstracts. And I guess, yeah, that would be something I'd be interested in looking into further." (value)

Even though participants could not download templates or checklists, they had expectations of what these resources might look like.

> "The checklist could be a pre-populated document that I can go through..it may have a table that I could go through as a tick box exercise ticking which of the \[guideline reporting items\] my study includes." (value)

> "[Regarding templates] I would like to adjust this template by myself. Just like a semi structured interview. I don't want this template be a structured interview. I want it to be semi structured so I can have the space to adjust it." (value)

Putting this information further up the page might help visitors "get" what RGs are about

> "would actually be very good to appear [higher up the page] because then it would now start opening up one's understanding as to exactly where this kind of guidelines might be applied." (value)

> "If any of these things: *writing research*, *checking manuscripts* and *planning research*, if these can be consolidated on [the top of] your landing page somewhere [...] it might might be beneficial because my thought process is that I need to know what I'm doing and only then reporting guidelines can help me, right? So if I know that this website gonna help me with writing the manuscripts, checking [...] I think then, reporting guidelines can make a logical progression in that particular case?" (value)

**Using a reporting guideline "for planning" was not intuitive**

The home page instructed that reporting guidelines can be used when planning research, but will not dictate design decisions. The SRQR page had a button to download a "log book" where researchers could document the decisions and data they would later need to report. However, no participants understood what this log book might be:

> "it's not immediately intuitive what a log book might be" (value)

> "OK, what's a log book? Don't know." (value)

> "nothing has been mentioned about the log book overhead. How [am I] gonna use the log book? Maybe you have mentioned about the template checklist, but uh, maybe we can add [something about] the log book." (value)

The word "planning" was not intuitive either. One thought this meant planning a manuscript, and so confused the purpose of the log book with that of the template. Another interpreted it as guidance for writing a research proposal.

> "When I when I'm reading planning research, I think maybe I have already done this when I design my own outline." (value)

> "To write can help you plan a study. Yeah, I guess it's... I I would have thought this might be useful if you're writing a research grant or a research proposal." (value)

I had ordered the tasks and tools as "drafting", "checking" and then "planning". I put planning at the end because it is the least conventional way to use a reporting guidelines. Some participants questioned this ordering:

> "Why is planning at the end? You have to plan first before you write." (value)



#### For each item, provide examples of reporting in different contexts

**Many participants said they wanted more, varied examples**

Each reporting item in SRQR comes with one or more examples from published literature. All participants stressed the usefulness of these examples. The attention examples received was notable because I did not ask about them; all comments about examples came spontaneously from the participant in the think aloud and plus minus tasks. 

> "Oh, and you have examples that could be really helpful, yeah." (value)

> "the most important thing I would say is the examples" (value)

> "I found [this section] very useful as they give more detailed explanations on each specific section, and particularly the examples." (value)

However, many participants said they wanted more examples, and greater variation in style, length, and conciseness.

> "need further explanation and examples" (value)

> "it would would have been useful or helpful for me to to have more than just one example." (value)

> "illustrations of how to [report] this information in a concise manner, that would be very helpful as well." (value)

> "you may as well put a whole discussion in there, or at least just sort of three or four paragraph discussion" (value)

> "And here if there could be more examples, because when I [...] started to read through and understand the the PRISMA guidelines and use the official explanation file to try to understand exactly what I'm required to write about and the examples particularly helped me a lot." (value)

Many participants wanted examples from their own field, or even entire publications that have used the guideline:

> "So I want something more relatable, [because] when I was reading these examples they were not relevant to my work." (value)

> "...if you can list some [...] papers who use the SRQR, you can put it here." (value)

> "I've searched and pubmed to find an example of a research article that's used these standards so I could copy or check how they've laid it out, which subheadings they've used." (value)

**Citations may be less credible if they are old or not referenced**

In the original SRQR publication, all examples are referenced. I had not included references for the examples when putting them onto the website because of time constraints. This bothered one participant.

> "Well, there's no references there, so is that a very good example? No, I don't know the source of these things. [...] You know, I don't know, where did it come from? Where's the reference?" (value)

When I asked about hypothetically labelling examples as fake if they were made up, the participant said "Yeah, I guess that would be alright". 

The same participant also noted that an example was quite old (10 years). 

**Citations could be more useful if explained or annotated**

Because some reporting items contain multiple sub-items, one participant said annotating examples may be helpful. Taking a discussion item about transferability and integrating findings, they suggested "if you could underline or maybe indicate [in the example] that _this_ [sentence] is now how they are trying to say the result can be transferable, umm, this is another [sentence] trying to say how they're trying to integrate.... something like that." (value)

|                                     | And I also talk about this with my friends because lots of my     |
|                                     | friends, they are also PhD students and they are struggling at    |
|                                     | writing too. So ask them if they have some guidance, uh, if they  |
|                                     | have looked at some guidance and if [they] have put those         |
|                                     | guidelines in [their] own writing and and their answers were,     |
|                                     | like, quite similar with me and and they all talk about that,     |
|                                     | "yes, we we look at lots of guidance we try to look at lots of    |
|                                     | those writing books to teach you how to write, to teach you how   |
|                                     | to structure your writing." But it's still very hard, and when    |
|                                     | you, when you really, when you really sit down and start writing, |
|                                     | actually you couldn't, uh, call up [the information]." ?var:|                                     |

#### Barriers

Participants naturally discussed barriers and facilitators they encountered when applying guidance, either during this study or in their previous experience. These factors were external to the website being tested, and I had identified many of them in my previous work (chapters {{< var.chapters.synthesis >}}-5. Participants mentioned:

- Not having known what reporting guidelines were earlier in their career
- Feeling frustrated when asked to use a reporting guideline or checklist when they have already finalised their manuscript and are submitting to a journal.
- (Previously) finding the checklist, but not the full guidance
- Being limited by journal requirements and word limits
- Struggling to keep writing concise and fluid
- Needing more guidance
- Being unable to report an item because it is their colleague's responsibility, or because they hadn't done what was being asked when designing their study or collecting data.
- Paywalls
- Using reporting guidelines for teaching students
- Wanting guidance for funding applications
- Funders enforcing reporting guidelines

Participants also mentioned barriers I had not identified previously. These included:

- When guideline author names appear Western, some (non western) participants expected the guidance to be less relevant to them.
- Describing a guideline as "version 1.0" might make people feel like the guidance is (too) new, and therefore less trustable.
- The loading speed of websites (thankfully, this was not an issue for the website being tested)
- Not understanding reviewer feedback
- Not wanting to read on a screen
- Not understanding the relationship between the EQUATOR Network and the guidelines or guideline developers.

#### Comparisons between the website being tested and the old EQUATOR website & guideline publications.

A few participants ended up exploring the _original_ EQUATOR website and the _original_ SRQR publication during their interviews. Participant's drove these unplanned explorations and comparisons. One wanted to retrace their steps to show me the guideline they had used previously. Two others wanted to continue using reporting guidelines in the future and asked me where the original SRQR guidance could be found. Some others spontaneously reflected on their previous experience.

Recounting their experience of seeing the original EQUATOR website for the first time between interview sessions, one participant (value) said "Ohh no I didn't like it. The [new] one is much, much better" because it looked more "trustworthy, more organised" and they preferred the font and colours. Another participant described the original website as "boring", "outdated" and "text heavy" before recounting their experience of using it: 

> "Not that long ago I went on to the site because I was looking to complete a reporting checklist and it seemed clear to find the checklist that I wanted. But when I went through the checklist, it wasn't appropriate. And then I just ended up feeling a bit unsure about what it is, which was the best one to go for." (value)

I witnessed another participant (value) experience similar confusion. They wanted to find the original SRQR guidance to continue using it after the study finished. Sharing their screen and thinking aloud, they started on the EQUATOR Network home page and tried to find the original SRQR guidance without my help. Although at first they thought EQUATOR's home page looked "full" and "rich", they were quickly "confused" by both EQUATOR's website and the SRQR publication. After eight minutes and giving up three times, they eventually found the checklist but not the supplement containing the full guidance. 

A second participant (value) achieved the same outcome a few minutes faster. Because examples only appear in the full guidance (which they hadn't found) they instead looked through "the reference list to see if there was potentially an example paper" and then planned to "go back to PubMed and search for an article that used these guidelines". The participant appeared to have little interest in the article's text, saying they did not "care what [the guideline developers] did to come up with it". 

Another participant (value) echoed this opinion when comparing the original SRQR publication with the redesigned version. They said they "don't need" to know how SRQR was made when they are trying to use it, and they felt the redesigned guidance is "a bit more precise and to the point". When I showed them the original SRQR full guidance (the supplement), they said:

> "Participant: That's too heavy on the content.
> 
> Interviewer: So if if the option was between this this version that you're looking at now [the supplement] and the the website that you saw first, which do you think you prefer to use?
> 
> Participant: I think [the website] is far better than the [supplement]. Yeah, this one [the website] is far better."

Another participant reflected on their previous experience of using the PRISMA guidelines and explanation document. They said:

> "I rather prefer this form [the website] of guidance than the other one. There can be a lot more information that are being presented in this way. [...] That's better because it it's more (how can I say?) well presented, well laid out, so that where I need to go deeper, I can go easily. Where I need just surface information or the parts that I'm already familiar with, I can just scroll through [...] So I think I'll prefer something presented in this way than the than the document that I read" (value).
