# Outline

## Introduction

### Recap

-   Previous work
-   Current output

### Evidence Gap

-   What it is: how could the guidelines/home page be further improved?
    -   How do we define improvement? Are we successfully implementing our intended implementation functions?
    -   What opportunities / barriers we have overlooked or introduced?
-   Examples
-   Why it is important?
    -   Self evident.
    -   Extra important because a) authors have been neglected b) esp non western / non quant (from my work and previous work)

### Justify qualitative approach

-   Reasons to prioritize qual over quant

    -   Generate ideas / hypotheses, not looking to confirm, compare or quantify.

    -   Many different intervention components

        -   Logic model differs. Some work within seconds, some aim to persuade unconsciously, others require reading/conscious thought and consideration. A questionnaire would not cover this.
