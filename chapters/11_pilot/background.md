Defining intervention components by their target barriers and intervention functions lends itself nicely to designing a pilot study to gather feedback. Because I knew what each component was supposed to be _doing_ I could design an interview schedule with questions and tasks to specifically explore intervention functions. ~For example, the purpose of the top of the home page is to communicate what reporting guidelines are and how they benefit authors. Instead of asking general questions (like "what do you think of...?"), I decided to ask more specific questions ("What do you think the website is about? How do you think it might influence your work?"). Furthermore, because the purpose was to communicate these things _quickly_, I decided to only give pilot participants 5s before asking these questions.~ Similarly, defining components in this way will facilitate future quantitative work to assess efficacy.
