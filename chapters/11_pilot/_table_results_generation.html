<p>Some complex words in the redesigned SRQR guideline had blue dotted lines underneath. When participants clicked them, a definition would pop up. Participants stressed usefulness of this feature, and everybody liked that the definitions appeared in a popup, and not on a new page.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I got great help there for me as a writer.” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-MJ</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“One feature that I really found to be very useful was where you [described] different kind of kinds of terms there […] When I’m not quite sure about the term there was. If I clicked on it, there was a description and that was very clearly written out and it made it quite easy to use the information that was there.” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-OMK</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Participants wanted more definitions within the guidance (some struggled with words like “transferability” or “generalizability”) and other areas of the website. For example, when reading about the scope of SRQR and related guidelines, participants struggled to understand terms like “qualitative evidence synthesis”</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“A qualitative evidence synthesis. What’s that? Is that like a review?” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-CW</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When reading a list of guidelines for different study types on the home page, one participant explained how not understanding terms like “cohort study” led her to feel anxious and worried.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Actually, I feel a little anxious because I’m not sure whether it shows that I am not good at something or I am ignorant or something. So when I saw all of these and, like half of them, I didn’t know. I may feel anxious and maybe, like, lose confidence sometimes.” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-YD</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>User experience might be clearer if definitions were signified by a different colour (not blue)</strong></p>
<p>Because I wanted to know whether future users would discover this functionality by themselves, I asked participants what they expected the dotted lines to signify. Most participants guessed correctly.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Interviewer: Like what do you expect those dotted lines to mean? Participant: Umm, I think dotted lines would mean that it will give me a definition.” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-HA</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“It’s not exactly a hyperlink, but it might give you a definition or something like that” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-VS</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, a couple of participants thought the lines might signify hyperlinks, and another thought it was a misspelt word because it looked like Microsoft Word’s autocorrect feature.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I’m honestly not sure whether I see just a highlight or it’s a link. Or what it is Usually links are in blue completely in blue.” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-WH</strong></p>

<td><p>Cater to different kinds of user (readers vs dippers) by structuring guidance with headings, itemisation, hyperlinking to particular sections, and with optional content</p>
<p><em>Features: SRQR items are structured consistently, making information easier to find. Itemisation is used consistently, content is hyperlinked when useful.</em></p>
<p><em>Barriers addressed: Researchers may expect the costs to outweigh benefits</em></p></td>
<td><p>Overall, participants welcomed the structure and navigation features, including headings, consistent subheadings for each guideline item, navigation menus, and links to sections.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I find the guideline more interactive than simply, you know, a PDF document. So I really appreciate that it was more structured and the guide was more easy to follow. And somehow having all these other, umm options, you know that the web offers, yeah […] For me it was very useful for moving around more easily and more quickly” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-MJ</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Participants liked having extra content as notes, but footnotes might not be optimal implementation</strong></p>
<p>When an SRQR item contained extra context or explanation not relevant to all users, I moved this into a note. I wa not sure of the best way to implement notes.</p>
<p>I tried footnotes, but participants expected the footnote identifiers (superscript numbers) to be references, and did not like how reading the footnote took them to the bottom of the page, away from where they had been reading:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I think it’s a citation. So uh linked to a reference. But I think it may also be foot note.” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-VS</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“[Superscript numbers are] always a link to, like, a reference. If not a reference like some…[clicks it]…okay, so it’s telling me things. It’s probably not a reference like in Wikipedia. It shows you it’s a link. This one is telling me more things. So it’s a footnote.” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-RW</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I worked hard to scroll down. I’m not gonna go back up. So, whatever, i’m not reading [it].” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-RW</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Menu navigation was useful but could be more prominent and go one level deeper</strong></p>
<p>The redesigned SRQR guideline has a side navigation menu so users can easily navigate to the Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion guidance sections, or to the FAQs and citation information. A few participants did not notice the menu, or suggested it could be more prominent, and one suggested it would be useful if the menu listed all reporting items.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“when I scrolling I forgot to pay attention to the menu on the side. So […] I suddenly realized it was a menu there […] Maybe make it much more, like, the characters larger or, like, the colour, maybe change it, because now it is so light and I didn’t pay attention to that. But this menu is useful if I pay attention to this.” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-YD</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each reporting item has its own menu so users can jump to the item’s justification, examples, or related resources. The same participant described these item menus as a useful way to help “find the detailed part” they desired.</p>
<p><strong>Section URLs could be more intuitive</strong></p>
<p>When the mouse hovers above a reporting item heading, a button would appear to allow users to a copy the URL to that specific section. One participant did not find this intuitive, and thought the button would take them to more information instead.</p>
<p><strong>Participants may desire a summary of the guidance</strong></p>
<p>In the think aloud, one participant said they would prefer to browse the checklist above the full guidance because “in my head, like the checklist probably has these things already” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-RW</strong>, and expected the checklist to act as a summary. This expectation may explain why another participant said “I just want to see what this thing is and at the moment I don’t know. Should I read the guidelines or checklist?”, perhaps because they desired an overview <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-CW</strong>.</p>
<p>“So maybe not the full guideline, but I’m not sure how how you can present it. Maybe one paragraph, or, uh, or you could present a mind map. Maybe you can present a mind map and you can put the keywords of this guideline. So if people want to see, for example, […] introduction, literature review, methodology, blah blah. Something like this.” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-JZ</strong></p>
<p><strong>Participants found item titles hard to spot when scrolling</strong></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“The names of the sections are, like, black and a little plain. So I think […] the name of each section should be somehow highlighted” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-MJ</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“And they don’t really stand out in my opinion, like, just about the layout of the page themself. You see, this [heading] doesn’t stand out so much from the rest, just the font is a little bigger. For example, if I’m scrolling through it very fast, it may be I might miss it. So if those headings or subheadings could be made more visible…” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-WH</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Some participants did not expect / want all guidance on one page</strong></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I didn’t expect it to be part of the same page because, just looking at the side [menu] here, it makes it a very long page to scroll through. So I guess what I’m a bit more familiar with is, you know, you click on something, it takes you to the guidance and then each of [the items] might be on a separate page […] So it’s less of a scroll and more of a click.” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-</strong></p>

<p>The top of the guideline page references the original SRQR publication.

</blockquote>
<p>The FAQs helped clear up this relationship, and some participants recommended they be signposted (or briefly explained) at the top of the guidance page.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“[The FAQ section about development] gave me more information about how [the guideline] came about. You know, I was asking [for] that when we first spoke, and here it was.

<blockquote class="blockquote">
