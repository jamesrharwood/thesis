There is no way I could have kept so many intervention components in my head. Using multiple methods was a nice way of covering everything without having to remember everything. 

But not everything was covered. Some components were never discussed. Maybe these were less prominent and so unnoticed? Or not discussed because not problematic? Or perhaps they are important and should not have been overlooked, so the fact they were not noticed is a problem? 

In future, I should code as I went, and then made a note to purposefully ask about components that had not come up naturally previously.
