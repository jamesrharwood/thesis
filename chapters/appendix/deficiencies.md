### Include design, features, and language to foster trust

######## Relevant website features: Professional design. EQUATOR's Logo remains prominent. Citation metrics are presented at the top the reporting guidance. Information about who developed the guidelines, how they developed it, and why the guidance is credible is still provided, and easily findable from the top of the guidance.

######## Barriers addressed: Researchers may not believe stated benefits

See text

### Describe what reporting guidelines are where they are first encountered

######## Relevant website features: Prominent definition on home page and guideline page.

######## Barriers addressed: Researchers may not know what reporting guidelines are

See text

### Use tone of voice and design to communicate personal benefits; confidence and simplicity

######## Relevant website features: A clean, simple interface for the home page and guidance pages. Text uses phrases like "confidence", "quick", "maximum impact".

######## Barriers addressed: Researchers may not believe stated benefits

See text

### Describe personal benefits and benefits to others where reporting guidelines are introduced (home page, on resources, in communications)

######## Relevant website features: Benefits are prominently and consistently displayed across the home page and guidance pages. Descriptions prioritize personal benefits to the authors above hypothetical benefits to others.

######## Barriers addressed: Researchers may not know what benefits to expect

See text

### Clarify what tasks (e.g., writing, designing, or appraising research) guidelines and resources are designed for

######## Relevant website features: Clear instruction and differentiation of resources

######## Barriers addressed: Researchers may not know what reporting guidelines are; Researchers may not know when reporting guidelines should be used

See text

### For each item, provide examples of reporting in different contexts

######## Relevant website features: SRQR already had some examples. No more examples added

######## Barriers addressed: Researchers may not know how to report an item in practice

See text

### Define key terms

######## Relevant website features: SRQR now has a glossary, and text is marked-up with definitions that appear upon click.

######## Barriers addressed: Researchers may misunderstand

**Participants wanted more definitions within the guidance _and_ on the rest of the website**

Some complex words in the redesigned SRQR guideline had blue dotted lines underneath. When participants clicked them, a definition would pop up. Participants stressed usefulness of this feature, and everybody liked that the definitions appeared in a popup, and not on a new page.

> "I got great help there for me as a writer." {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-MJ >}}

> "One feature that I really found to be very useful was where you [described] different kind of kinds of terms there [...] When I'm not quite sure about the term there was. If I clicked on it, there was a description and that was very clearly written out and it made it quite easy to use the information that was there." {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-OMK >}}

Participants wanted more definitions within the guidance (some struggled with words like "transferability" or "generalizability") and other areas of the website. For example, when reading about the scope of SRQR and related guidelines, participants struggled to understand terms like "qualitative evidence synthesis"

> "A qualitative evidence synthesis. What's that? Is that like a review?" {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-CW >}}

When reading a list of guidelines for different study types on the home page, one participant explained how not understanding terms like "cohort study" led her to feel anxious and worried. 

> "Actually, I feel a little anxious because I'm not sure whether it shows that I am not good at something or I am ignorant or something. So when I saw all of these and, like half of them, I didn't know. I may feel anxious and maybe, like, lose confidence sometimes." {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-YD >}}

**User experience might be clearer if definitions were signified by a different colour (not blue)**

Because I wanted to know whether future users would discover this functionality by themselves, I asked participants what they expected the dotted lines to signify. Most participants guessed correctly. 

> "Interviewer: What do you expect those dotted lines to mean?
> Participant: Umm, I think dotted lines would mean that it will give me a definition." {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-HA >}}

> "It's not exactly a hyperlink, but it might give you a definition or something like that " {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-VS >}}

However, a couple of participants thought the lines might signify hyperlinks, and another thought it was a misspelt word because it looked like Microsoft Word's autocorrect feature.

> "I'm honestly not sure whether I see just a highlight or it's a link. Usually links are in blue, completely in blue." {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-WH >}}

> "I think uh, there are some misspelled words" {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-SK >}}

### Cater to different kinds of user (readers vs dippers) by structuring guidance with headings, itemisation, hyperlinking to particular sections, and with optional content

######## Relevant website features: SRQR items are structured consistently, making information easier to find. Itemisation is used consistently, content is hyperlinked when useful.

######## Barriers addressed: Researchers may expect the costs to outweigh benefits

Overall, participants welcomed the structure and navigation features, including headings, consistent subheadings for each guideline item, navigation menus, and links to sections. 

> "I find the guideline more interactive than simply, you know, a PDF document. So I really appreciate that it was more structured and the guide was more easy to follow. And somehow having all these other, umm options, you know that the web offers, yeah [...] For me it was very useful for moving around more easily and more quickly" {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-MJ >}}


**Participants liked having extra content as notes, but footnotes might not be optimal implementation**

When an SRQR item contained extra context or explanation not relevant to all users, I moved this information to a footnote, but participants expected the footnote identifiers (superscript numbers) to be references, and did not like how reading the footnote took them to the bottom of the page, away from where they had been reading:

> "I think it's a citation. So uh linked to a reference. But I think it may also be foot note." {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-VS >}}

> "[Superscript numbers are] always a link to, like, a reference. If not a reference like some...[clicks it]...okay, so it's telling me things. It's probably not a reference like in Wikipedia. It shows you it's a link. This one is telling me more things. So it's a footnote." {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-RW >}}

> "I worked hard to scroll down. I'm not gonna go back up. So, whatever, i'm not reading [it]." {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-RW >}}

**Menu navigation was useful but could be more prominent and go one level deeper**

The redesigned SRQR guideline has a side navigation menu so users can easily navigate to the Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion guidance sections, or to the FAQs and citation information. A few participants did not notice the menu, or suggested it could be more prominent, and one suggested it would be useful if the menu listed all reporting items (i.e.,. not just _Methods_, but also the item titles within). 

> "when I scrolling I forgot to pay attention to the menu on the side. So [...] I suddenly realized it was a menu there [...] Maybe make it much more, like, the characters larger or, like, the colour, maybe change it, because now it is so light and I didn't pay attention to that. But this menu is useful if I pay attention to this." {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-YD >}}

Each reporting item has its own menu within the collapsible content, so users can jump to the item's justification, examples, or related resources. The same participant described these item menus as a useful way to help "find the detailed part" they desired.

**Section URLs could be more intuitive**

When the mouse hovers above a reporting item heading, a button would appear to allow users to a copy the URL to that section. One participant did not find this intuitive, and thought the button would take them to more information instead. 

**Participants may desire a summary of the guidance**

In the think aloud, one participant said they would prefer to browse the checklist above the full guidance because "in my head, like the checklist probably has these things already" {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-RW >}}. They expected the checklist to act as a summary. This expectation may explain why another participant said "I just want to see what this thing is and at the moment I don't know. Should I read the guidelines or checklist?", perhaps because they desired an overview {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-CW >}}. 

"So maybe not the full guideline, but I'm not sure how how you can present it. Maybe one paragraph, or, uh, or you could present a mind map. Maybe you can present a mind map and you can put the keywords of this guideline. So if people want to see, for example, [...] introduction, literature review, methodology, blah blah. Something like this." {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-JZ >}}

**Participants found item titles hard to spot when scrolling**

> "The names of the sections are, like, black and a little plain. So I think [...] the name of each section should be somehow highlighted" {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-MJ >}}

> "And they don't really stand out in my opinion, like, just about the layout of the page themself. You see, this [heading] doesn't stand out so much from the rest, just the font is a little bigger. For example, if I'm scrolling through it very fast, it may be I might miss it. So if those headings or subheadings could be made more visible..." {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-WH >}}

**Some participants did not expect / want all guidance on one page**

> "I didn't expect it to be part of the same page because, just looking at the side [menu] here, it makes it a very long page to scroll through. So I guess what I'm a bit more familiar with is, you know, you click on something, it takes you to the guidance and then each of [the items] might be on a separate page [...] So it's less of a scroll and more of a click." {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-VS >}}

### Explain how the guidance was developed and why it can be trusted

######## Relevant website features: Brief description included on home page and at top of reporting guideline, links to full to development information

######## Barriers addressed: Researchers may feel patronized

**The relationship between the website and publication could be clearer**

The top of the guideline page references the original SRQR publication. Some participants said this helped them trust the website, but others voiced confusion about the relationship between the publication and webpage, whether the guidance matched, and which they should cite. 

> "I know I have the information to look for the paper and I could find it. So yeah, it inspires trust and it's amazing to have it here." {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-MJ >}}

> "Is this [content on the website] now this article? Because if it is the article then I'm not clear on that [...] [After reading through the item titles] Do they match?...Yes, they match." {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-CW >}}

The FAQs helped clear up this relationship, and some participants recommended they be signposted (or briefly explained) at the top of the guidance page. 

> "[The FAQ section about development] gave me more information about how [the guideline] came about. You know, I was asking [for] that when we first spoke, and here it was. It was nice to be able to see [that] somebody put this together. [...] I like that I could get more information about the background. So in a way it's not really a frequently asked question. It is actually the background." {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-CW >}}

> "I think it's very fine to put it here [in the FAQs], but I'm just thinking about, like, could we put a link or a summary at the very beginning of the website? Because it may make me trust it much more quickly." {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-YD >}}

### Make guidance appear shorter by removing superfluous information, hiding optional content, splitting long guidelines, using concise language, and separating design advice

######## Relevant website features: SRQR has been edited. The only text presented immediately is instruction on what the author needs to describe. Additional information is hidden at first and can be expanded. Text is shortened through editing and by using active voice. In the case of SRQR, this reduced the text length by 60%.

######## Barriers addressed: Researchers may expect the costs to outweigh benefits

**On first impression, the guidance may appear too long**

Participants spoke positively of the various features to hide optional content (like collapsible sections and pop-ups). Nobody expressed wanting all information up front, and all preferred to have it only when needed. 

> "If you want to, you can extend and read through [the extra information]. I think that's very useful." {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-WH >}}

> "but if you don't need [the extra information], uh, you can't see it. But if you need it, you may click on it and just show it very directly." {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-YD >}}

However, some participants still felt the guidance appeared very long, and this could be off-putting upon first impression. 

> "So I kind of know how long this page is based on seeing [the scroll bar] move. I don't want to read the whole thing [...] I don't want to spend 17 min on that" {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-RW >}}

In the first iteration, the page was even longer because of content in the introduction before the guidance began (e.g., information about the guideline's scope, development, or how to use it).

> "There's so much going on [at the top of the page, before the guidance]. [...] Yo, this is getting annoying. All I want is the guideline or the document" {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-CW >}}

In the second iteration, I moved some of this introduction information into a collapsible box, but some participants still described the page as very long.

### Create spaces for authors to discuss reporting guidelines with others

######## Relevant website features: Each reporting item has its own discussion board.

######## Barriers addressed: Researchers may not believe stated benefits; Researchers may misunderstand; Researchers may not know how to report an item in practice; reporting guidelines can become outdated; Researchers may feel patronized

Each reporting item had a link to its own discussion page. Participants welcomed the opportunity to post comments, ask questions, and suggest edits on this page. 

> "So you do not want to just show people how to do it, but you want to provide a platform for the readers to discuss and to create their own ideas. I think that's great." {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-JZ >}}

> "Maybe what helps is if you can, say, share your thoughts here, [...] you feel a little bit more [that] _I've got a voice_ instead of _I'm just being told that it's a great place to be and it's got all the answers_." {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-CW >}}

> "Maybe if I identify something that I know is not useful for me. Yeah, in that case, maybe I would write something, you know, to other researchers to read it and maybe give feedback about it, but also for developers of the guideline." {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-MJ >}}

**The button could be clearer**

The link to the discussion page was a button with an icon of a speech bubble, no text, and not all participants knew what this button would do or where it might take them. One participant said this button would be easier to understand if it used text, and recommended it be placed at the end of the expandable content for each item.

> "Maybe the blog? No, I don't know." {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-MJ >}}

> "I thought it might be, uh, like a frequently asked questions or a or a further explanation" {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-HA >}}

> "I think you can just put [a button] after all the [extra] content you have seen [in the expandable box], because if if people haven't seen this content they will have nothing [to discuss]." {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-JZ >}}

**The discussion page could be easier to use**

The discussion page requires users to sign in before they can post. This deterred some participants. 

> "Ohh I see I need to sign in. Ah, usually that is something that discourages me immediately." {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-WH >}}

> "I would comment, if I didn't have to log in" {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-RW >}}

Additionally, one participant did not understand the discussion page's purpose.

> "Am I doing this to myself? Is it comments about my research that I'm completing the guidance for or is it for the website for other people to see these comments that I've made perhaps?" {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-VS >}}

### Address communications to authors

######## Relevant website features: All resources and website copy are directed predominantly at authors.

######## Barriers addressed: Researchers may feel that checking reporting is someone else's job.

**Participants expected the target audience was researchers, but the target could be more specific**

Everyone recognised the website was for researchers, as opposed to editors. Most realised it was for _health_ researchers.

> "It can be useful for academics. It can be useful for people who do research on daily basis or as a regular part of their job" {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-SK >}}

Some participants specified the target might be _early career_ researchers or university students. 

> "those who are just getting started in the career journey in research....\[pause\]...definitely students?...umm.... people who don't really have that much experience in writing." {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-OMK >}}

> "Maybe like master research or higher degrees and also for some junior scholars" {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-YD >}}

> "But I think your your target audience is completely different than the very basic student...because it's more for the expert researchers, right... for the expert researchers" {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-SK >}}

Some participants hinted that seeing terms specific to their field signalled that the website was for them:

> "If I know any of these terms, then clearly I'm gonna make use of it" {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-SK >}}

> Ohh then maybe if it sounded like "Want help writing up **Qualitative research** or something like that, so that I know that this is actually addressing me. It's relevant to me. Yeah, but \[the way it is written now\] way is kind of open. So it's not kind of, it's not relating to me. {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-OMK >}}

### Structure guideline items to make them quicker to digest

######## Relevant website features: Items have consistent structure and use bullet points consistently

######## Barriers addressed: Researchers have limited time

Participants welcomed items' structure and said they preferred it to unstructured text. 

> "It was more structured and and the guide was more easy to follow." {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-MJ >}}

One participant questioned whether they might prefer full sentences over bullet points. They used SRQR's item 12 as an example, where the text says:

> "If the actual sample differs from the target sample, describe:
>
> * the difference,
> * why these differences may have occurred,
> * how this might affect the findings."

The participant suggested changing this to "Why the difference has occurred and how it might affect the findings. So one line and you're done with it", instead of taking up four lines of text." {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-SK >}}

### Describe the scope of a reporting guideline at the top of every resource

######## Relevant website features: The intended scope of a guideline is clearly & prominently described. This definition includes contexts in which the guidance should not be used.

######## Barriers addressed: Researchers may not know whether a reporting guideline applies to them

**Not all participants found the scope clear**

One participant was not clear whether SRQR applied to survey studies, and said they wanted a definition of what _qualitative research_ meant. Another participant wondered why the guidance discussed patient outcomes when the scope had not specified health research. 

### Search function on website

######## Relevant website features: Search function is easier to find as a recognizable icon in the navigation bar of every page. The home page includes additional ways to access search functionality.

######## Barriers addressed: Guidance may be difficult to find

The website featured search buttons (one in the navigation menu, one at the top of the home page), but the search buttons did not work, so participants could not explore the search functionality. However, many participants commented on the search buttons and instinctively knew what they were.

### Include testimonials from research users who benefit from complete reporting

######## Relevant website features: SRQR includes dummy testimonials and quotes from research users

######## Barriers addressed: Researchers may not care about the benefits of using a reporting guideline

**Quotes helped participants believe items were important, but some participants questioned their credibility**

The redesigned SRQR guidance featured quotes in the margin of some items from people that use research, like evidence synthesisers, editors, or other researchers. These quotes were made up, as I didn't have time to collect real ones just for testing. Some participants said they liked these quotes: 

> "I think it makes this....how can I say?...practical from a different point of view. Like why exactly you need this [reporting item]. So now this person [in the quote] is telling from her own perspective how useful it is that you have [the item] described clearly, so it makes it such that if I'm trying to describe [this item], I'll try to keep that in mind that." {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-WH >}}

> "I like it because each of them tells me the why...umm...you know, kind of gives a plain language reason for [...] why it's a useful thing. [...] That's gives it, you know, humanity." {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-HA >}}

However, some participants questioned whether these quotes were from real people.

> "Maybe they're real...maybe it's legit" {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-RW >}}

**Quotes may not be valuable enough to be prominent**

Some participants didn't find the quotes useful, or described them as distracting. 

> "I don't care what people think." {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-CW >}}

> "I didn't really pay much attention to it. I saw a few quotes and read through a few quotes, but I was like, _OK, so what does that add to me?_" {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-OMK >}}

> "sometimes when I have to read [something complicated], but I don't want to, [distraction] may be a big problem for me because, like, these comments are what people say, so it's, like, more easy to read than the [reporting item]. So it may attract a lot of attention from me" {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-YD >}}

### Include testimonials from researchers who were nervous about being punished for reporting transparently

######## Relevant website features: Quotes included alongside guideline

######## Barriers addressed: Researchers may expect the costs to outweigh benefits

Some of the fictitious quotes contained reassurance from researchers who had felt nervous when using a reporting guidelines because they felt unsure about being so transparent about parts of their work they knew were not perfect. There were only a couple of quotes of this kind, and few authors noticed or commented on them.

> "That makes it relatable to a user, particularly a new user, because we can see that all of these people are, you know, they were first time users once." {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-HA >}}

### Instruct authors to cite reporting guidelines so readers may learn about them

######## Relevant website features: Consistent instruction to cite reporting guidelines

######## Barriers addressed: Researchers may not know what reporting guidelines exist

**The title _How to cite_ was misleading to one participant**

Participants expected citation instructions and most were not surprised to see them in a section called _How to cite_. However, one participant questioned whether the section would tell them how to cite the guidance, or how to cite resources in general. 

> "I want to see, like, if it says right away, a certain citation style like, are you talking about Chicago?" {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-RW >}}

**Some participants did not know whether to cite the website or the publication**

One participant said they had sought the original paper because they "wanted to add the citation" {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-MJ >}} to their article. Another asked "Do you reference the EQUATOR network or do you reference the original article?" {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-CW >}}.

**Some participants recommended the citation instruction be more prominent**

> "I think you can put citation in a in a box in a [coloured] box to make people notice it." {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-JZ >}}

> "It is helpful of course, umm, but I think it got lost in the page." {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-MJ >}}

### Explain when reporting guidelines do not intended to prescribe structure

######## Relevant website features: Explained at top of guidance

######## Barriers addressed: Researchers may struggle to reconcile multiple sets of guidance

**Some participants included sub headings for each reporting item in their writing sample**

Many participants noticed and welcomed the clarification that SRQR does not prescribe structure. Nobody objected to it.

> "I think this is very clear. If you say that did not prescribe order nor structure. [...] Yes, that's great. [...] I like it very much because I think it helps me understand that the guideline is not a standardized one, but it depends on the user. To use this kind guide in their own context. So I think this one this sentence is is very important." {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-JZ >}}

In the writing task, two participants used subheadings for the items they wrote. When asked about these subheadings in the second interview, both said they intended to remove at least some of the subheadings. One participant replied "One of our reviewers wanted more structure, so of course we leave some [subheadings] in, but not all" {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-MJ >}}. Another said "I'll probably not include them [in my final article], but the information, that's what I'm I'm going to maintain, yeah." {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-OMK >}}

### Provide links to other resources that explain how an item can be done

######## Relevant website features: Links included when relevant.

######## Barriers addressed: Researchers may not know how to do an item

**Participants mentioned needs that are not addressed by the current links**

Most participants voiced support for links to helpful resources. None were against them.

> "I wasn't really expecting this here. But then it's useful. These two [links] seem useful." {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-WH >}}

However, participants wanted links to other resources, including resources to help them with "flow charts" {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-MJ >}}, "writ[ing] in a concise manner" {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-OMK >}}, "sample size calculations" {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-VS >}}, and more item-specific "training" {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-WH >}}, possibly including "videos" {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-BH >}}.

### Links between related guidelines

######## Relevant website features: Guidelines prominently link to other relevant guidelines and explain when they should be used.

######## Barriers addressed: Researchers may not know what reporting guidelines exist

The top of the guideline page included information on SRQR's scope and links to other, related guidelines. Participants said they liked these links. Most found the explanations clear, including the instructions of when _not_ to use SRQR. 

> "This part, _when I should not use this guideline_, I think it is much useful for me to understand whether I use the right guideline or not. Yeah. [...] I need this judgment." {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-YD >}}

> "[Reading out loud] _Do not use it for writing a qualitative evidence synthesis. use this instead_. OK, that could be useful." {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-WH >}}

**Not all participants understood the term 'related guidelines' or differences between similar reporting guidelines**

> "why would you put _related_ if if you're saying _use this one, but then you could also use this one_... I think that really starts to get confusing." {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-CW >}}

> "Initially it seemed confusing which guidelines to use when doing mixed methods research" {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-VS >}}

### Educate authors about writing as a process

######## Relevant website features: Some SRQR items now link to relevant EQUATOR materials and courses.

######## Barriers addressed: Researchers may not consider writing as reporting

**The website did not sufficiently address participants' need for writing training** 

The top of the SRQR guideline page had short instructions about how to apply the reporting guideline whilst writing but for many participants, this was not enough. Many participants expressed desire for training on _how_ to write an article (as opposed to _what_ to write). 

One participant wanted training on how to "write in a concise manner" {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-OMK >}}

Another talked about their struggle to apply training and guidance to their own writing process.

> "When I try to look at your guidance on your website, I really want to use it in my own writing, but it is very strange because when I try to, uh, connect the information on the website with my own writing, I found there there might be a great gap because I think everything on your website is very clear (actually they are very specific, those suggestions), but when I try to connect those information with my own writing, I found it just a little bit difficult to generate some some specific ideas to start my writing.
>
> So I'm thinking if that's because the problem of my writing is not the lack of specific guidance but some other thing like my motivation or, I don't know...it's just a little bit strange.
> 
> And I also talk about this with my friends because lots of my friends, they are also PhD students and they are struggling at writing too. So ask them if they have some guidance, uh, if they have looked at some guidance and if [they] have put those guidelines in [their] own writing and and their answers were, like, quite similar with me and and they all talk about that, _'yes, we we look at lots of guidance we try to look at lots of those writing books to teach you how to write, to teach you how to structure your writing. But it's still very hard'_. When you really sit down and start writing, actually you couldn't, uh, call up [the information]." {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-JZ >}}

### For each item, explain why the *information* is important and to whom (not just what constitutes "good" design)

######## Relevant website features: Information added when necessary

######## Barriers addressed: Researchers may not know why items are important

**The labels _Justification_ and _Why readers need this information_ were ambiguous to some participants**

Each reporting item included a section within its expandable content called _Why readers need this information_ alongside examples of writing and links to other resources. Participants found the information useful but were less enthusiastic than they were for the examples.

> "So yeah, this this section, justification, examples and resources. I found them very useful as they give more detailed explanations on each specific section, and particularly the examples" {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-WH >}}

However, a few readers interpreted the title of this subsection differently. 

> "I thought it might give you an example of how to justify [the choices you made in your study]" {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-VS >}}

> "I was asking myself: _which readers?_.... the one like me who is using the platform or the readers of my paper?" {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-BH >}}

**Not all participants found the justification compelling**

Whereas many participants spontaneously said how useful examples were, none said the same about the justification section. 

> "[It was] one of those things that you just read and go, like, _ohh OK_. But not, like, something which I requested or you sit down and think through." {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-OMK >}}
> 
> Interviewer: Maybe this section could do a better job of reminding authors who is going to be reading their research, and how different those people might be. Or their different perspectives or experiences. Do you think if it had done that you would have found it a bit more convincing and motivating?
> 
> Participant: Umm. Definitely, definitely. From your explanation, I think it kind of puts it in context, [as to] why this section is more important. So I didn't read it at first, but I think it did not come up very clearly as compared to how you've explained it. And so, after hearing that explanation, I'd say that this the way the readers need information." {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-OMK >}}

### For each item, provide clear instruction of what needs to be described

######## Relevant website features: Writing instruction occurs first for each item.

######## Barriers addressed: Researchers may not know how to report an item in practice

**One participant felt the instructions could be a little longer and less ambiguous**

Each reporting item began with instructions of what to write. Participants welcomed these instructions, as articulated by one participant when describing how they used the guideline for the writing task, "I used it specially for understanding what kind of information, you know, apart from the obvious ones, every section wants me to write, so it it was really helpful in that respect" {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-MJ >}}.

However, one participant suggested the information could be a little longer: "I guess just a few more words to kind of, articulate [the instruction] better or give it a bit more detail [because it may be ambiguous to] somebody less experienced" {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-VS >}}.

### Gather and communicate evidence for benefits

######## Relevant website features: Dummy quotes provides evidence for experienced benefits.

######## Barriers addressed: Researchers may not believe stated benefits

**Participants questioned whether quotes were credible**

The website included (fake) quotes from authors exalting the personal benefit reporting guidelines have brought to their job (e.g., easier writing, smoother publishing). Some participants found these compelling, but others worried these quotes were biassed, fake, or vague.

> "This is encouraging because it's a feedback from a person working at the journal with responsibility for publishing. The editor." {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-BH >}}

> "If you're using quotes on a website, my first thought is you could be biasing, you know, how useful the website is, because you've picked out great quotes so, you know, until I've looked at this and used it myself, I might not agree" {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-CW >}}

> "Maybe you can put some concrete stories, because for me I like to read stories instead of just reading some uh, broad words like I like it. Yeah." - {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-JZ >}}

> "Yes, I think it's much more useful [to] have some timelines to show when people say [things], yeah, because if I could see the time, I may also check like how long the company or the website may [have] last[ed] for [...], how many people use that and how they are feeling like from one year ago or two years ago to now." {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-YD >}}

### Provide advice regarding how to respond if asked to remove reporting guideline content by a colleague, editor, or reviewer

######## Relevant website features: Advice given in FAQ

######## Barriers addressed: Researchers may be asked to remove reporting guideline content

**Many participants did not notice the advice**

The FAQ section included some advice on what to do if a colleague or editor asked you to remove content from your manuscript pertaining to one or more SRQR items. Only one participant noticed this advice. When talking about what they would do if asked to remove content by "a reviewer or, even a co-author, it was amazing for me that you give these tips, you know, to what to do in those cases and what you can do to, umm, make it or to highlight the importance of have each section within your paper." {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-MJ >}}

Another participant, who had not noticed the advice, nevertheless said they would return to the website should they be asked to remove content: 

> "I think first I will ask his or her reason why he or she want me to delete that if I think, I don't agree with that. I may try to make some formal explanation to explain that and also I may come back to this website to double check some reliable things which can support my view to let them believe that I should also I I need this paragraph." {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-YD >}}

### Use plain language

######## Relevant website features: SRQR is edited to use plainer language.

######## Barriers addressed: Researchers may misunderstand

**Participants did not understand all words**

I had tried to use plain language on the home page and introduction to SRQR, but participants still questioned the meaning of some words (e.g., "synthesis"), including words commonly used by EQUATOR staff (e.g., "transparency"). Even the term "reporting guidelines" confused some participants, especially when used at the start of a sentence, where some participants interpreted the word "reporting" to be a verb, instead of part of a compound noun. 

### Link all resources to each other

######## Relevant website features: Guidance links to all tools and development article

######## Barriers addressed: Researchers may not know what resources exist for a reporting guideline

Participants noticed links to resources, such as the buttons to download checklists and templates. 

### Reassure that all research has limitations to encourage explanation over perfect design

######## Relevant website features: This reassurance appears on the home page and all guidance pages

######## Barriers addressed: Researchers may expect the costs to outweigh benefits; Researchers may feel afraid to report transparently

Two participants spoke about content that reassured authors to be honest about limitations. After noticing a reassuring quote from an editor, one participant agreed, saying:

> "sometimes when we don't report limitations and the reviewer identifies the limitations [instead] then then we lose credibility. So it's better we report [limitations] so that the the reviewers say _ohh this person has acknowledged this limitation, then then this is a good study_. So I just liked it." {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-BH >}}

Another voiced support for the SRQR reporting item about limitations, saying "no study is ever done perfectly or done in a way that the next person would do it. And so we've become really, really good, I think, in my team, at making quite long limitation sections to try and avoid peer reviewers from finding everything that's wrong". {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-CW >}}

### Tell authors when to use reporting guidelines, or that reporting guidelines are best used as early as possible

######## Relevant website features: Stated prominently

######## Barriers addressed: Researchers may not know when reporting guidelines should be used

Upon realising reporting guidelines are for writing articles, all participants naturally thought about using them in the drafting/writing process (as opposed to retrospectively check manuscripts that are already written). Sometimes this was immediate:

> "From what I have seen [after the 5 second test], I think probably the website should be about, uh, helping you try to discover... identify the guidelines that you will use for writing your study quickly." {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-BH >}}

For some participants, using the guidance for the writing task reaffirmed their opinion that the guidelines would help them in early stages of writing. 

> "I saw it as very important for me at this stage that I'm at. I'm writing a manuscript. But I'd say that it can be usable at any level, only that I found it very important at my level, which is at my paper writing stage." {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-OMK >}} 

**No participants talked about consulting reporting guidelines when planning a study** 

Perhaps because participants did not intuitively understand how they could use a reporting guideline to plan research, none talked about using them in that way.

### Use consistent terms

######## Relevant website features: The website uses terms consistently

######## Barriers addressed: Researchers may misunderstand

**Participants were confused when different words referred to the same thing**

Two participants questioned why the home page referred to "guidelines" _and_ "reporting guidelines" and asked whether there was a difference. Another asked whether "guidance" and "guideline" were the same. Another participant noticed that an SRQR item 18 uses the word 'integration' in two different contexts: whereas the item asks authors to integrate their work with others', the example uses the word 'integrating' differently when discussing how their study combined modes of teaching.

### Avoid patronizing language

######## Relevant website features: Continue to avoid using patronizing language

######## Barriers addressed: Researchers may feel patronized

No participants mentioned feeling patronized. When asked, one participant described the tone as "suitable" and said "simple comments" and "explaining like this, \[is not patronizing\] because I also need a lot to learn." {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-YD >}}

### Centralised hosting

######## Relevant website features: A core set of frequently accessed guidelines are now presented on a single website.

######## Barriers addressed: Guidance may be difficult to find

That the website contains many different reporting guidelines was rarely mentioned, but one participant said "to have a repository where all those things are, instead of having to go and search for them. That makes sense." {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-CW >}}

### Provide translations

######## Relevant website features: Translations are prominently listed above the guidance

######## Barriers addressed: Researchers may not understand the language; Researchers may misunderstand

**One participant noticed that their language was missing**

> "So what about, you know, all the researchers that speak Spanish?" {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-MJ >}}

### Tell authors how long the guidance will take to read

######## Relevant website features: Estimated reading time given

######## Barriers addressed: Researchers have limited time

**Not all participants liked being told how long the guidance would take to read**

The guidance advises readers that it may take 16 minutes to read. One participant liked this: "Oh, I know how it's going to take. It's helpful when you are performing research you have like tight deadlines and not much time." {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-MJ >}}

But another felt like 16 minutes was too long, especially if you only found the guideline as part of manuscript submission "Uh, it will be frustrating. Now again, you waste a lot of time." {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-BH >}}. 

And a third (not a native English speaker) worried they would feel bad if the guidance took them longer than the stated time:

> "I think this is, like, useful, but I'm not sure whether some... when some people read it, they may feel stressful because, from my teaching experience before, some of my students may say to me if, like, there is guidance saying that you may need, like, 60 minute to read it, sometimes, if they take longer, they may feel confused, or lose a little bit [of] confidence [and worry that] they read it so slow or they are not, like, normal one. I think this [estimated time] _may_ be a good [information] because, like, nowadays I found, like, many websites use it. But actually, for me sometimes this part is useful, but sometimes it is not." {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-YD >}}

### Encourage explanation even when choices are unusual or not optimal

######## Relevant website features: Added to items

######## Barriers addressed: Researchers may feel afraid to report transparently

**Only one participant noticed this instruction**

Some reporting items in SRQR ask authors to explain their reasoning behind design choices. Only one participant noticed one of these sentences. They reflected that researchers often "follow this path of only mentioning [what we did] but not explaining how we did it and why it was important to apply this strategy" {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-MJ >}}. 

### Explicitly state when no better guidance exists for a use case

######## Relevant website features: Reporting guidelines warn authors when no better guidance exists for a use case, and how the current guidance can be adapted instead

######## Barriers addressed: Researchers may not know what reporting guideline is their best fit

**Only one participant commented on this instruction**

In the introduction to SRQR, where its scope is explained, the instruction mentions that there are no better reporting guidelines for writing _protocols_ for qualitative research, and instead recommends authors use certain items from SRQR. One participant annotated this explanation and said they liked it {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-JZ >}}.

### Provide instruction as to how and where information can be reported without breaching word count limits or making articles bloated.

######## Relevant website features: Added instruction at top of reporting guideline and in some items where most useful

######## Barriers addressed: Researchers may struggle to keep writing concise

**Only one participant commented on instructions of where content can be reported**

Very little of the guideline text deals with _where_ content can be reported (e.g., in the article body, in an appendix, a table, a figure). Only one participant noticed it and said "I like the reminder" {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-CW >}}.

### Reassure when guidelines are _just_ guidelines

######## Relevant website features: Prominently displayed at top of reporting guideline

######## Barriers addressed: Researchers may feel restricted if reporting guidelines prescribe design

**Only one participant drew the distinction that reporting guidelines are not rules**

Throughout the homepage and SRQR page I had tried to convey that reporting guidelines are recommendations, and I took care not to use words like _rules_ or _standards_. Only one participant commented explicitly about this, but no participants talked about the guideline as if it were a set of rules. 

> "So I think this explanation here is very clear that it helps researchers to know that definitely they can have their own ideas and this guideline is, it is kind of like a supporting one, but not a rule, not a standardized rule." {{< var pilot.participants.PPT-JZ >}}

### Ensure all resources and tools (e.g., checklists and templates) are in ready-to-use formats

######## Relevant website features: No changes made

######## Barriers addressed: Researchers have limited time; reporting guideline resources may not be in usable formats

Even though the links to the checklist and template were not live, participants expected the resources to be in ready-to-use formats. 

### Communicate why reporting is primarily the responsibility of the author

######## Relevant website features: Clear explanation of why guidelines and tools should be used by authors primarily, although can also be used by others.

######## Barriers addressed: Researchers may feel that checking reporting is someone else's job.

No participants commented on this. 

### Decrease fear of judgement by making reporting guidelines design agnostic

######## Relevant website features: SRQR explicitly states that it makes no assumptions about design. Inadvertent design assumptions were edited.

######## Barriers addressed: Researchers may expect the costs to outweigh benefits; Researchers may feel afraid to report transparently; Researchers may feel restricted if reporting guidelines prescribe design

No participants commented on this. 

### Explain importance of complete reporting to the scientific community

######## Relevant website features: Continue to do this

######## Barriers addressed: Researchers may not know why items are important

The website explains the societal and community importance of complete reporting in a few places: the justification subsections of each item, quotes in the margin, and briefly on the home page. 

Although participants commented on the quotes from research consumers, and on the _Justification_ sections within each reporting item, nobody talked about the negative impact of poor reporting on the scientific community at scale.

### Provide clear instruction of what needs to be described when an item was not done, could not be done, or does not apply

######## Relevant website features: Instructed where relevant

######## Barriers addressed: Researchers may not know what to write when they cannot report an item

This component was not tested and no participants commented on this. 

### Remove branding and messaging that may invoke feelings of judgement, complexity, or administrative red-tape

######## Relevant website features: A clean, simple interface for the home page and guidance pages. Text makes less use of judgemental phrases and fewer references to the negative consequences of poor reporting.

######## Barriers addressed: Researchers may expect the costs to outweigh benefits

No participants described the design as unpleasant or judgemental.

### Search Engine Optimization

######## Relevant website features: The site has additional meta-data. Each reporting guideline page has its own meta-data. The site is optimized for mobiles.

######## Barriers addressed: Guidance may be difficult to find; Researchers may not encounter reporting guidelines early enough to act on them

This component was not tested and no participants commented on this. 

### Use if-then rules to direct authors to more appropriate and up-to-date guidance when available

######## Relevant website features: Reporting guidelines clearly and consistently point authors to more appropriate guidance when appropriate, using if-then rules. These links can be updated any time.

######## Barriers addressed: Researchers may not know what reporting guideline is their best fit

Although participants commented on the links to related guidelines, they did not comment on the "if...then..." structure of these links.
