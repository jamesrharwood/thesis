<p class="heading">Barriers addressed: Researchers may misunderstand</p>
<p><strong>Participants wanted more definitions within the guidance <em>and</em> on the rest of the website</strong></p>
<p>Some complex words in the redesigned SRQR guideline had blue dotted lines underneath. When participants clicked them, a definition would pop up. Participants stressed usefulness of this feature, and everybody liked that the definitions appeared in a popup, and not on a new page.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I got great help there for me as a writer.” (ECR from Ecuador)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“One feature that I really found to be very useful was where you [described] different kind of kinds of terms there […] When I’m not quite sure about the term there was. If I clicked on it, there was a description and that was very clearly written out and it made it quite easy to use the information that was there.” (Pre-PhD student from Malawi)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Participants wanted more definitions within the guidance (some struggled with words like “transferability” or “generalizability”) and other areas of the website. For example, when reading about the scope of SRQR and related guidelines, participants struggled to understand terms like “qualitative evidence synthesis”</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“A qualitative evidence synthesis. What’s that? Is that like a review?” (Researcher from South Africa)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When reading a list of guidelines for different study types on the home page, one participant explained how not understanding terms like “cohort study” led her to feel anxious and worried.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Actually, I feel a little anxious because I’m not sure whether it shows that I am not good at something or I am ignorant or something. So when I saw all of these and, like half of them, I didn’t know. I may feel anxious and maybe, like, lose confidence sometimes.” (PhD student from China)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>User experience might be clearer if definitions were signified by a different colour (not blue)</strong></p>
<p>Because I wanted to know whether future users would discover this functionality by themselves, I asked participants what they expected the dotted lines to signify. Most participants guessed correctly.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Interviewer: What do you expect those dotted lines to mean? Participant: Umm, I think dotted lines would mean that it will give me a definition.” (Researcher from Australia)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“It’s not exactly a hyperlink, but it might give you a definition or something like that” (Researcher from the UK)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, a couple of participants thought the lines might signify hyperlinks, and another thought it was a misspelt word because it looked like Microsoft Word’s autocorrect feature.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I’m honestly not sure whether I see just a highlight or it’s a link. Usually links are in blue, completely in blue.” (Medical student from Ghana)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I think uh, there are some misspelled words” (ECR from India)</p>

<p class="heading">Barriers addressed: Researchers may expect the costs to outweigh benefits</p>
<p>Overall, participants welcomed the structure and navigation features, including headings, consistent subheadings for each guideline item, navigation menus, and links to sections.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I find the guideline more interactive than simply, you know, a PDF document. So I really appreciate that it was more structured and the guide was more easy to follow. And somehow having all these other, umm options, you know that the web offers, yeah […] For me it was very useful for moving around more easily and more quickly” (ECR from Ecuador)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Participants liked having extra content as notes, but footnotes might not be optimal implementation</strong></p>
<p>When an SRQR item contained extra context or explanation not relevant to all users, I moved this information to a footnote, but participants expected the footnote identifiers (superscript numbers) to be references, and did not like how reading the footnote took them to the bottom of the page, away from where they had been reading:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I think it’s a citation. So uh linked to a reference. But I think it may also be foot note.” (Researcher from the UK)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“[Superscript numbers are] always a link to, like, a reference. If not a reference like some…[clicks it]…okay, so it’s telling me things. It’s probably not a reference like in Wikipedia. It shows you it’s a link. This one is telling me more things. So it’s a footnote.” (Research consultant from the Philippines)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I worked hard to scroll down. I’m not gonna go back up. So, whatever, i’m not reading [it].” (Research consultant from the Philippines)</p>

<p><strong>Menu navigation was useful but could be more prominent and go one level deeper</strong></p>
<p>The redesigned SRQR guideline has a side navigation menu so users can easily navigate to the Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion guidance sections, or to the FAQs and citation information. A few participants did not notice the menu, or suggested it could be more prominent, and one suggested it would be useful if the menu listed all reporting items (i.e.,. not just <em>Methods</em>, but also the item titles within).</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“when I scrolling I forgot to pay attention to the menu on the side. So […] I suddenly realized it was a menu there […] Maybe make it much more, like, the characters larger or, like, the colour, maybe change it, because now it is so light and I didn’t pay attention to that. But this menu is useful if I pay attention to this.” (PhD student from China)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each reporting item has its own menu within the collapsible content, so users can jump to the item’s justification, examples, or related resources. The same participant described these item menus as a useful way to help “find the detailed part” they desired.</p>
<p><strong>Section URLs could be more intuitive</strong></p>
<p>When the mouse hovers above a reporting item heading, a button would appear to allow users to a copy the URL to that section. One participant did not find this intuitive, and thought the button would take them to more information instead.</p>
<p><strong>Participants may desire a summary of the guidance</strong></p>
<p>In the think aloud, one participant said they would prefer to browse the checklist above the full guidance because “in my head, like the checklist probably has these things already” (Research consultant from the Philippines). They expected the checklist to act as a summary. This expectation may explain why another participant said “I just want to see what this thing is and at the moment I don’t know. Should I read the guidelines or checklist?”, perhaps because they desired an overview (Researcher from South Africa).</p>
<p>“So maybe not the full guideline, but I’m not sure how how you can present it. Maybe one paragraph, or, uh, or you could present a mind map. Maybe you can present a mind map and you can put the keywords of this guideline. So if people want to see, for example, […] introduction, literature review, methodology, blah blah. Something like this.” (PhD student from China)</p>
<p><strong>Participants found item titles hard to spot when scrolling</strong></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“The names of the sections are, like, black and a little plain. So I think […] the name of each section should be somehow highlighted” (ECR from Ecuador)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“And they don’t really stand out in my opinion, like, just about the layout of the page themself. You see, this [heading] doesn’t stand out so much from the rest, just the font is a little bigger. For example, if I’m scrolling through it very fast, it may be I might miss it. So if those headings or subheadings could be made more visible…” (Medical student from Ghana)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Some participants did not expect / want all guidance on one page</strong></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I didn’t expect it to be part of the same page because, just looking at the side [menu] here, it makes it a very long page to scroll through. So I guess what I’m a bit more familiar with is, you know, you click on something, it takes you to the guidance and then each of [the items] might be on a separate page […] So it’s less of a scroll and more of a click.” (Researcher from the UK)</p>

<p><strong>The relationship between the website and publication could be clearer</strong></p>
<p>The top of the guideline page references the original SRQR publication. Some participants said this helped them trust the website, but others voiced confusion about the relationship between the publication and webpage, whether the guidance matched, and which they should cite.</p>

<p>“I know I have the information to look for the paper and I could find it. So yeah, it inspires trust and it’s amazing to have it here.” (ECR from Ecuador)</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The FAQs helped clear up this relationship, and some participants recommended they be signposted (or briefly explained) at the top of the guidance page.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“[The FAQ section about development] gave me more information about how [the guideline] came about. You know, I was asking [for] that when we first spoke, and here it was. It was nice to be able to see [that] somebody put this together. […] I like that I could get more information about the background. So in a way it’s not really a frequently asked question.

<p>In the first iteration, the page was even longer because of content in the introduction before the guidance began (e.g., information about the guideline’s scope, development, or how to use it).</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">

<p>The link to the discussion page was a button with an icon of a speech bubble, no text, and not all participants knew what this button would do or where it might take them.

<p><strong>The website did not sufficiently address participants’ need for writing training</strong></p>
<p>The top of the SRQR guideline page had short instructions about how to apply the reporting guideline whilst writing but for many participants, this was not enough. Many participants expressed desire for training on <em>how</em> to write an article (as opposed to <em>what</em> to write).</p>
<p>One participant wanted training on how to “write in a concise manner” (Pre-PhD student from Malawi)</p>
<p>Another talked about their struggle to apply training and guidance to their own writing process.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“When I try to look at your guidance on your website, I really want to use it in my own writing, but it is very strange because when I try to, uh, connect the information on the website with my own writing, I found there there might be a great gap because I think everything on your website is very clear (actually they are very specific, those suggestions), but when I try to connect those information with my own writing, I found it just a little bit difficult to generate some some specific ideas to start my writing.</p>
<p>So I’m thinking if that’s because the problem of my writing is not the lack of specific guidance but some other thing like my motivation or, I don’t know…it’s just a little bit strange.</p>
<p>And I also talk about this with my friends because lots of my friends, they are also PhD students and they are struggling at writing too. So ask them if they have some guidance, uh, if they have looked at some guidance and if [they] have put those guidelines in [their] own writing and and their answers were, like, quite similar with me and and they all talk about that, <em>‘yes, we we look at lots of guidance we try to look at lots of those writing books to teach you how to write, to teach you how to structure your writing. But it’s still very hard’</em>. When you really sit down and start writing, actually you couldn’t, uh, call up [the information].” (PhD student from China)</p>

<p>Participant: Umm. Definitely, definitely. From your explanation, I think it kind of puts it in context, [as to] why this section is more important. So I didn’t read it at first, but I think it did not come up very clearly as compared to how you’ve explained it.

<p>Two participants spoke about content that reassured authors to be honest about limitations. After noticing a reassuring quote from an editor, one participant agreed, saying:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“sometimes when we don’t report limitations and the reviewer identifies the limitations [instead] then then we lose credibility. So it’s better we report [limitations] so that the the reviewers say <em>ohh this person has acknowledged this limitation, then then this is a good study</em>. So I just liked it.” (Midwifery student from Uganda)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another voiced support for the SRQR reporting item about limitations, saying “no study is ever done perfectly or done in a way that the next person would do it. And so we’ve become really, really good, I think, in my team, at making quite long limitation sections to try and avoid peer reviewers from finding everything that’s wrong”.

<p>Upon realising reporting guidelines are for writing articles, all participants naturally thought about using them in the drafting/writing process (as opposed to retrospectively check manuscripts that are already written). Sometimes this was immediate:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“From what I have seen [after the 5 second test], I think probably the website should be about, uh, helping you try to discover… identify the guidelines that you will use for writing your study quickly.” (Midwifery student from Uganda)</p>

<p>For some participants, using the guidance for the writing task reaffirmed their opinion that the guidelines would help them in early stages of writing.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I saw it as very important for me at this stage that I’m at. I’m writing a manuscript. But I’d say that it can be usable at any level, only that I found it very important at my level, which is at my paper writing stage.” (Pre-PhD student from Malawi)</p>

<p>The website explains the societal and community importance of complete reporting in a few places: the justification subsections of each item, quotes in the margin, and briefly on the home page.</p>
<p>Although participants commented on the quotes from research consumers, and on the <em>Justification</em> sections within each reporting item, nobody talked about the negative impact of poor reporting on the scientific community at scale.</p>
