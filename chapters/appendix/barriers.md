### 1: Researchers may not know what reporting guidelines are{#sec-what-are-rgs}

Researchers may have never heard the term "reporting guideline" or may misunderstand it. Researchers may more commonly use terms like “writing” or “writing up” and the word "reporting" may get interpreted as a formal task (such as reporting progress to a funder). The word "guideline" may be interpreted by some as rules (as per journal "author guidelines") and others as recommendations. Some researchers may perceive reporting guidelines as a set of design requirements, especially if they only use checklists, which typically lack the instructions and nuances included in the full guidance.

### 3: Researchers may not know whether a reporting guideline applies to them{#sec-scope}

If the scope of a reporting guideline is undefined or unclear, then researchers won’t know whether the guidance applies to them. Researchers may not understand study designs, making it difficult for them to identify which guidance applies.

### 4: Researchers may not know what reporting guideline is their best fit{#sec-best-fit}

Researchers may not know when more specific guidance exists. An author's “perfect fit” guideline may not exist, in which case they may not know know when to stop searching, and they may try to use an "imperfect fit" guideline without understanding which items are applicable.

### 5: Researchers may not know what resources exist for a reporting guideline{#sec-what-resources-exist}

Resources include the guidance itself, checklists, E&E files, templates, and web tools (e.g., PRISMA flow chart maker). Not all resources exist for each reporting guideline and researchers may be unaware of the ones that do. Many researchers may only use the checklist. Sometimes this is purposeful, but other times it may be because researchers don’t know that full guidance and examples exist.

######### [Make resources easy to discover and find](#sec-findable-resources)



### 6: Researchers may not know when reporting guidelines should be used{#sec-when-to-use}

Researchers may not know when they should use reporting guidelines in their research workflow. Guideline developers may want researchers to use guidance as early as possible, but this is may not be obvious to researchers who may only ever receive instruction to complete a checklist as part of journal submission and may [never discover the full guidance](#sec-what-resources-exist). Consequently, researchers may assume that reporting guidelines are supposed to be used by single authors as pre-submission checklists to demonstrate adherence. It may not occur to them that reporting guidelines can be used earlier, or by teams. Some researchers, having come to this realisation themselves, report wanting to be told to use reporting guidelines earlier in their research.

### 7: Researchers may misunderstand{#sec-understanding}

Researchers may not understand concepts, terms or words within the guidance, or they may understand them differently to how the developers intended. Some items (or entire guidelines) might be new concepts. e.g., SQUIRE guidelines written at a time where Quality Improvement was still a new concept to many people, and some items (e.g., Context, Study of the intervention) were less familiar than others. Researchers may have nowhere to turn for help should they not understand something.

### 8: Researchers may not know what benefits to expect{#sec-benefits}

Researchers may not know what benefits to expect from using a reporting guideline. These benefits may include:

* improved completeness of reporting which helps readers use research and reduces research waste.
* improved flow and less “waffle” in writing
* facilitated discussions between collaborators, especially at the design or protocol stage
* publishing and passing peer review more efficiently
* increased publisher acceptance rates
* efficient, confident writing
* increased impact of manuscript, as the article is easier to search for and information within the article is easier to find.

######## Ideas to address this barrier:

######### [Describe reporting items fully](#sec-item-content)



### 13: Researchers have limited time{#sec-need-enough-time}

Guidelines take time to find, read, understand, and apply. Sometimes they may require time and work from multiple co-authors. Researchers & guideline developers may underestimate the time required for writing, and time is often most limited at the point of submission as grant funding may have run out.  

Checklists take time to complete, and completing them with page numbers or pasted content can be annoying if future edits necessitate updating the checklist too. Checklists also generate work for editors and peer-reviewers who must cross check page numbers or pasted content with manuscript content.

### 14: Researchers may not encounter reporting guidelines early enough to act on them{#sec-need-right-time}

Some reporting guideline items require work that has to be done within a certain time windows such as:

* during planning or designing
* before or during data collection
* when other colleagues are available
* during the duration of a grant

### 15: Researchers may not understand the language{#sec-need-translations}

Researchers may not understand the language guidance is written in. A lot of research comes from countries where English is not the first language, as do a lot of EQUATOR website visitors. Even if a researcher speaks English as a second language, language may be an additional barrier.

### 16: Researchers may struggle to keep writing concise{#sec-need-concise-writing}

<!-- # ASK: Should I use bold to show the separate parts of a recommendation? -->
Following a guideline can result in lengthy, bloated reports which are unpleasant to read and breach journals' word limits. Researchers may not know how to keep writing fluid and concise or where they can report an item (e.g., what section, in the text or in a table or figure, in the manuscript or in supplementary material).

Researchers use reporting guidelines for different tasks and want tools to make that job easier. Researchers report using reporting guidelines for:

* Planning research
* Designing research
  * Researchers report wanting items presented in the order in which decisions need to be made
  * Researchers report wanting links to resources
* Whilst collecting data
  * Researchers report wanting items ordered in the order they are done
  * Resaerchers report wanting items embedded into data collection tools
* Drafting manuscript

######## Ideas to address this barrier:

######### [Make updating guidelines easier](#sec-updating)



### 19: Researchers may struggle to reconcile multiple sets of guidance{#sec-need-to-reconcile}

Researchers must adhere to journal guidelines, multiple reporting guidelines (e.g., PRISMA + PRISMA-Abstracts + PRISMA-S) and other best practice guidelines (like NIH principles). Using multiple guidelines increases complexity and costs, and guidelines can contradict each other.

### 21: Researchers may forget to use reporting guidelines at earlier research stages{#sec-need-prompts}

NB forgetting is different to [not realising](#sec-when-to-use) that reporting guidelines can be used early.

######### [Create ways to catch authors earlier](#sec-early-acquisition)



### 22: Guidance may be difficult to find{#sec-need-findable}

Researcher should be able to easily find guidance and resources that they believe to exist. However:

* search functions can be hard to find or use,
* researchers may not know which search terms to use,
* websites may be hard to navigate,
* guidance can be buried within articles,
* resources may not be optimised for search engines,
* and resources may not be in the same place.

######## Ideas to address this barrier:

######### [Make resources accessible](#sec-accessible)



### 24: reporting guideline resources may not be in usable formats{#sec-need-usable-formats}

Resources differ in how easy or readily usable they are. For example, some checklists are published as PDF tables that cannot be filled or copied. Some guidance can be dense, unstructured text that is hard to digest or navigate; whereas some researchers will read the guidance sequentially, others may dip in and out whilst writing, and unstructured text can make information harder to find.

### 26: Researchers may feel restricted if reporting guidelines prescribe design{#sec-feel-restricted}

Advice or assumptions about design choices narrow the scope of the guidance and can make checklists appear prescriptive. Sometimes design assumptions can be implicit. For example, in requiring authors to report the method used to assess risk of bias, PRISMA is implying that authors should have designed their review to assess risk of bias.
