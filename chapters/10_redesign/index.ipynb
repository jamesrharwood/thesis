        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "The output of my focus groups was a long list of ideas. This list included ideas from all stakeholders, including myself, and fed into step 7 of Michie et al.'s guide to applying the Behaviour Change Wheel @michieBehaviourChangeWheel2014. In chapter (see {{< var chapters.workshops >}}) I explained why I expanded on this step. In this chapter I describe my process in more detail by explaining how I used behavioural analysis to identify behaviour change techniques. I then describe how I turned ideas into intervention components and developed these components into an intervention prototype. By intervention component, I mean a designed element that uses one or more behaviour change technique, which is theorized to work through one or more intervention functions to target one or more behavioural drivers. An intervention _change_ is the addition or removal of an element. Defining intervention content in this way is useful because it helps intervention developers to understand why the component has been added (or removed), how it is theorised to be working and, therefore, how its effectiveness may be tested.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Behavioural Analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Methods\n",
        "\n",
        "For every idea generated from the workshops and focus groups, I labelled which barriers it was addressing, which behavioural drivers it was targeting, and which intervention functions it was employing to do so. This list was data driven, in that it was based upon the ideas and barriers generated from previous research (see chapters {{< var chapters.synthesis >}}, {{< var chapters.review >}}, {{< var chapters.web-audit >}}, {{< var chapters.journal-audit >}}, {{< var chapters.workshops >}} and {{< var chapters.focus-groups >}}). To give structure and context to this list, I grouped ideas according to the sub-behaviours they targeted: 1) engaging with guidance and 2) applying it (see section on identifying the target behaviour in chapter {{< var chapters.workshops >}}).\n",
        "\n",
        "Once all ideas were coded, I selected ideas to implement by considering a) whether they could be incorporated into a web-based intervention, b) the priority of the intervention function (determined in objective 2), and c) whether I could feasibly deliver the idea within the time constraints of my DPhil.\n",
        "\n",
        "#TODO: my results table currently includes _all_ ideas at the moment. But some of these ideas aren't actually intervention components (some are modes of delivery e.g. \"provide training\" or \"networks of champions\"). And I've not included all of the ideas in my intervention. Given that I already report all \"ideas\" in the appendix (and results section of the focus group chapter), I think it might be more useful to just report the intervention components that I've taken forward into the pilot or _could_ include in the website going forward.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Results\n",
        "\n",
        "See table @tbl-int-plan for all {{< var counts.ideas >}} ideas, labelled with the barriers they address, the drivers they target, the intervention functions they use, and whether I could implement them.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Building the intervention\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Purpose\n",
        "\n",
        "The result of my behavioural analysis was a list of components that were abstract. “Reassuring language” or “design that communicates simplicity” could be realised in many different ways. To build a working prototype that could be piloted I had to make these real.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Methods and Results\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Designing the intervention\n",
        "\n",
        "I began by describing how each intervention component could be realised and how this compared to the existing system (see #tab-int-plan). In doing these comparisons, I looked at how the EQUATOR website is currently, and I made generalisation about how popular reporting guidelines are disseminated, and the content of their Example and Elaboration documents and checklists.\n",
        "\n",
        "Designing was iterative and collaborative. I included the same members of EQUATOR UK that had participated in the workshops. We met 3 times between November 2022 and January 2023 to discuss intervention design. In our first meeting, we decided which webpages required redesigning, and how webpages should be navigated. On the existing website, authors starting on the home page must visit up to 5 webpages to reach the full reporting guidance. Many authors leave at each step and so few reach the guidance. We redesigned this workflow to reduce this journey to 2 webpages - the EQUATOR home page, and a reporting guideline page containing the full guidance. These different website layouts are visualised in @fig-sankey-b4 and @fig-sankey-after.\n",
        "\n",
        "Workshop participants then sketched ideas for how the home page and guidance pages could be laid out and where intervention components could be placed. Once participants had agreed on a layout, I created an alpha version of the new website and invited members to comment on it. These were webpages that could be viewed in a browser, but used dummy text and images. After another round of feedback I refined the alpha version, populated it with real text and images, and participants gave feedback again. The new pages can be viewed in @fig-home, @fig-rg-intro, and @fig-discussion, and can be compared with the old pages in @fig-home-b4 and @fig-db-b4.\n",
        "\n",
        "My intention was to create guideline pages for a sample of the most frequently accessed guidelines so that the website felt real for pilot participants. However, many intervention components involved changing the wording and layout of the guidance itself. Editing multiple guidelines was neither feasible not necessary, as we only needed one edited guideline to pilot the new website.\n",
        "\n",
        "I selected SRQR as my test guideline to edit because I was familiar with it, having used it when writing up my own research, and because I felt it would make a good guideline to test with (see next chapter for why). I got written permission from Bridget O'Brien, the lead developer or SRQR, and from the publisher. I kept Bridget up to date with my work and invited her feedback.\n",
        "\n",
        "I began editing SRQR by pasting the text into Microsoft Word and rearranging content into categories: what to write, how/where to write it, what to write if the item wasn't/couldn't be done, why the item is important and to whom, examples. I edited sentences to speak directly to authors. E.g. \"Describe X\" instead of \"Authors should describe X\", and to use active voice. This shortened the text and made it clearer that the primary audience is authors.\n",
        "\n",
        "For composite items I split the sub-items into bulleted lists. E.g.\n",
        "\n",
        "> For each X, describe:\n",
        ">\n",
        "> * X\n",
        "> * Y\n",
        "> * Z\n",
        ">\n",
        "\n",
        "I rearranged conditional sub-items so that they read \"If X, then describe Y\", rather than \"Describe Y if X\". I moved definitions into the glossary and contextual information into notes. I edited the resulting text to join it back together. I edited the tone of voice to add reassuring language. An example of the redesigned guidance can be viewed in #sec-box-item.\n",
        "\n",
        "After development, I double checked the intervention against the initial list of intervention components to ensure I had covered all of them. I consulted with EQUATOR members to verify that the components were realised as expected and invited another round of feedback.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### System architecture\n",
        "\n",
        "When considering architecture options I prioritized technology that could feasibly be maintained by EQUATOR staff or a future PhD student. I looked for tools that would be familiar to early career researchers. I considered DIY website builders (like Wix or Squarespace) but these services can be expensive. Most offer a 'drag and drop' building experience which, although easy to use, is a laborious way of uploading and formatting large amounts of content. Should EQUATOR want to change how an item is presented, they would have to manually edit each item for each reporting guideline. Additionally, our intended intervention changes required custom functionality that wasn't offered by these services (e.g. integration with a DOI minting service, glossary definitions, discussion boards).\n",
        "\n",
        "Although coding languages like `html` or `javascript` are used by many software developers to create websites, few early career researchers are familiar with them. I decided on `markdown`, an incredibly simple language that can be learnt in a few minutes. It uses asterisks, underscores, and carets to make text **\\*\\*bold\\*\\***, _\\_italic\\__, or ^\\^superscript\\^^. Headings, URLS, and references are similarly easy, and can be simplified further by using one of many readily available editors that make writing markdown feel like writing a Microsoft Word document.\n",
        "\n",
        "Many researchers write reproducible manuscripts in markdown using tools like RStudio or Quarto. Quarto can turn markdown into many different file formats including docx, pdf, and html (a website). Quarto documents can be further customised using programming languages commonly used in research, like Ruby or Python. Quarto requires no technical knowledge, is easy to learn, has great documentation, and is open source.\n",
        "\n",
        "The website is served using Github Pages which is free, beginner friendly, configurable, and integrates (almost) seamlessly with Github's version control system which will already be familiar to many researchers. I wanted EQUATOR to have ultimate control over the website. I also wanted guideline developers to have selective access to edit their own guideline content but not to other guidelines. I have built the website such that each reporting guideline is stored in its own repository on Github, accessible only to its developers. These guideline repositories are then \"pulled in\" to the main EQUATOR repository, so EQUATOR can double check changes that developers make before allowing them to go live on the site.\n",

        "## Discussion\n",
        "\n",
        "I have demonstrated how I have used a data-driven approach, guided by behaviour theory, to re-design how reporting guidance is disseminated. I have proposed {{< var counts.redesign.intervention-components >}} intervention components, addressing {{< var counts.redesign.barriers-targeted >}} barriers and employing {{< var counts.redesign.intervention-functions-used >}} intervention functions. By linking components with barriers and functions, I have justified my suggestions using evidence and described how they are theorized to work. I have then created a prototype website to demonstrate how these components could be realised.\n",
        "\n",
        "Together, these changes amount to a complete redesign of two key parts of the existing system through which reporting guidelines are currently disseminated; the guidelines themselves, and the EQUATOR Network website which is visited by almost 1 million authors each year.\n",
        "\n",
        "### When comparing current intervention\n",
        "\n",
        "This reassessment required participants to take a step back and look at the current set-up with fresh eyes. We did this informally. Some participants shared long-standing frustrations with the website or guidelines. One participant shared designs she had created years ago for a redesigned EQUATOR website. Other times, after discussing a barrier or idea, we would go to the guidelines to see how things are  done currently.\n",
        "\n",
        "So this comparison was ad-hoc, and I have included pieces of it in this chapter purely to provide context to the proposed changes. I sought out examples of a behaviour change technique being implemented, not being implemented, or being implemented poorly. I made generalisations about RGs using words like \"some\" or \"few\" to give an impression of how frequently RGs currently use a given BCT. These frequency descriptions are based on my own observation, and not on a formal audit.\n",
        "\n",
        "I considered systematically auditing the content of EQUATOR Network website and popular guidelines to see which behaviour change techniques they employ and which of our ideas were already present. I decided against this  for two reasons. Firstly, with so many  ideas and so many guidelines, this would have taken time and I decided instead to prioritize building and testing a prototype. Secondly, this audit wouldn't have dramatically influenced the intervention components we designed, but would merely quantify how different my proposed intervention is to the current set-up. Who would be interested in quantifying this difference? Perhaps my thesis examiners, and perhaps the guideline development community. But quantifying differences wouldn't bring me any further towards helping authors or impacting reporting quality, like building a prototype would. Should the guideline development community need that evidence then this audit could be done in the future once the redesigned intervention has been refined (see next chapter) and finalised.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Limitations & reflections on process\n",
        "\n",
        "Using a framework and a systematic method helped participants (and I) to check our biases. Instead of relying on personal preference, we tried to ensure choices reflected the function we were trying to employ. For example, when choosing a background image, instead of asking \"do you like this one?\", the questions became \"what feelings do you think this image conveys? Does it communicate simplicity?\". Working as a group helped mitigate individual preferences and peculiarities.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, there is no avoiding the fact that many decisions required a degree of subjectivity and, as lead researcher, designer, and developer, often these decisions landed on my shoulders. I tried to mitigate this by involving EQUATOR members in the workshops and development process, prioritizing their ideas over my own, and providing many opportunities for feedback. But the result definitely has my “stamp”. If someone else had built it using the same table of intervention components then some things might be the same (like simplifying the user journey from 5 steps to 2, or the conventional layout of the home page) but other things would look very different (like the choice of wording and images).\n",
        "\n",
        "Using a framework also helped participants to consider options that may not have otherwise come to mind. However, our imagination may have been constrained by what already exists. Although I encouraged blue-sky thinking, participants often focussed on tweaking what already exists instead of starting from a blank slate. If reporting guidelines didn't exist, how else might we have tackled poor reporting? If EQUATOR didn't exist, would we have a similar organisation to fill its place? How might that organisation be structured, governed, and what kind of legal entity might it be? If the publishing industry didn't exist, might we have imagined different ways of describing research that were more formulaic than free-form articles?\n",
        "\n",
        "These imagination constraints may be a weakness, but they are also al practical. EQUATOR is in a privileged position that in that it is known and trusted by publishers, guideline developers, and many authors. Thousands of journals and authors already use reporting checklists. So whilst the changes proposed in this chapter (and the ideas proposed in the chapter before) may be criticised for not being radical enough, for an organisation (and a PhD student) with limited time and resources, it makes sense to improve a system that already has significant buy-in from the academic community, over and above destroying that system or trying to create a new one from scratch.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our horizons may have also been limited by group-think. If I were to repeat the work, I would have included a small, diverse group of authors to take part in the design process. I would have invited representatives from the publishing industry, funding community, and people more familiar with designing digital behavioural interventions. Including these diverse, informed voices in the design process could have lead to more radical design choices.\n",
        "\n",
        "I did, however, include guideline developers in the design process. When editing SRQR I made sure to include Bridget O'Reilly, SRQR's lead author, in every step. I explained my process and invited her feedback during and after editing. The experience was very positive. Bridget was supportive of what I was doing and liked the end result. But I acknowledge that other guideline developers may feel protective over their writing, and that many may not have the time nor funding to revise their guidance. I discuss these limitations further in my discussion chapter.\n",
        "\n",
        "Editing SRQR revealed another limitation: gaps in item description. There was often no guidance of what to write if an item wasn't or couldn't be done. For instance, the target sample size item had no instruction of what to write if you didn't ever have a target in mind. Some items were missing any kind of justification of why the item was important and to whom. Bridget and I both felt that filling these blanks would require time and input from SRQR's development team, and so I left these gaps unfilled for now.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Future work\n",
        "\n",
        "I anticipate similar gaps for other reporting guidelines, and would seek to work alongside guideline developers to fill them and I upload other popular reporting guidelines and edit items into a consistent structure using the same process as for SRQR. Further development work will be required before the new website can be made live. Some of this work are technical tasks that, although necessary, do not have behavioural impact. For example, I will need to integrate the new website as a subdomain of EQUATOR's existing one, and I will create automated tests that run before each deployment. However, other tasks _do_ appear on the list of intervention ideas, and will affect behaviour. For example, I intend to optimise each guideline page so that it ranks highly in search engines.\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond the intervention components presented here, the prioritization exercise identified other ideas that EQUATOR would like to implement, but that I chose not to act upon. For example, participants favoured developing training resources specific to individual reporting items, and creation of network of “reporting champions”, akin to the UKRN model. EQUATOR participants liked the idea of lobbying funders to require reporting guidelines be used for applications. The work in this chapter could be used to support funding applications to support these endeavours.\n",
        "\n",
        "I mentioned earlier that one limitation of this study was that authors weren't included in the design process. In the next chapter, I explain how I have addressed this by piloting the website amongst authors.\n",
