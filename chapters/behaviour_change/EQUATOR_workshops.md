Explain what the BCW is and why it was developed. 

Define behavioural drivers, intervention functions, and policy categories.

Describe the suggested method that is included int he book.

In their book (@michieBehaviourChangeWheel2014), Michie et al. provide worksheets that guide you through the process of defining the behaviour you are interested, diagnosing barriers in terms of the underlying behavioural drivers, and selecting intervention components. Specifically, these worksheets help you:

1. define the problem in behavioural terms,
2. identify which behaviours could bring about the desired change and selecting one to focus on,
3. specify the chosen target behaviour in terms of who needs to do what, when, where, how often, and with whom,
4. identify what needs to change in order for the target behaviour to occur, and categorize these changes according to their underlying behavioural drivers (from COM-B),
5. identify which intervention functions you could use,
6. identify which policy categories you could use,
7. identify behaviour change techniques (from a taxonomy) based on the intervention functions chosen identified in step 5 and,
8. identify modes of delivery (e.g. face-to-face, internet, mobile app etc.).

Explain how I worked through a this process with EQUATOR and how (and why) I tailored it. 

## Workshop details

I worked through these steps on my own to get a feel for the BCW and whether it could help and to reflect on my own beliefs and ideas. Once familiar, I was able to lead workshops with {{< var counts.EQUATOR_staff >}} members of the UK EQUATOR Centre to go through the process again. 

The EQUATOR team met {{< var counts.EQUATOR_meetings >}} times between December 2021 and May 2022, with each meeting lasting around 2 hours. I would ask everyone to consider the worksheets on their own or in pairs before discussing as a group. Everybody could edit the worksheets, which were shared over Microsoft Teams, but usually only one person acted as a scribe. I withheld my own ideas until the end of a session or task, whereupon others could discuss them and add them to the document if desired. Most of my ideas came from my familiarity with the literature or from my experience as a software developer, and contributing them at such an early stage meant that EQUATOR staff and future focus group members could interrogate, modify and disagree with them.

## Defining the target behaviour

Describe worksheets and tasks for steps 1-3.

Our first objective was to select and define our target behaviour. Although my previous chapters focussed on _authors_ (as opposed to editors, supervisors, or peer reviewers etc.), these chapters threw up multiple behaviours that I could now choose to target. For example, did I want authors to complete a checklist upon journal submission? Read guidance from start to finish before putting pen to paper? Adhere to guidance? Visit a particular page on the EQUATOR Network website? I needed to select and define the desired behaviour more exactly.

#TODO: describe worksheets one and two?

In the first workshop we defined our key behaviour in terms of _who_ needed to do _what_, _when_, _where_, and in what _context_. Workshop participants drafted definitions on their own before discussing as a group and co-editing a shared file.

Our final definition of our target behaviour was: **Researchers should use reporting guidance as early as possible in their research pipeline. They will do this for every piece of research, at their place of work, on their own but in the context of collaboration**

Participants broke this key behaviour into two sub behaviours:

1. Engage with reporting guidelines as early as possible (ie access and read them) and,
2. Apply the guidance to their writing as intended by the guideline developer.

By "research pipeline" we mean the many steps involved in a typical project which may include ideation, obtaining funding and ethics permission, designing, writing a protocol, drafting a manuscript, editing a manuscript, submitting a manuscript. Instead of specifying _which_ stage reporting guidance should be used, we decided to specify that we want authors to use guidance as "early as possible". We did this for a few reasons. Firstly, guidelines differ in how easily they can be used for writing protocols or applications. Secondly, researchers will naturally come across reporting guidelines at different stages of their work. Should a researcher discover a guideline at the point of journal submission, then we would still want them to apply the guidance then, even though this is a relatively late stage. But by specifying "as early as possible", we declare our hope that _next time_ that same researcher may decide to use a guideline at an earlier point. And finally, not all research projects will begin with a written funding application, ethics application, or protocol.

By "apply", we refer to using guidance to plan, write or edit a written description of research (e.g. within a manuscript or application). Applying guidance includes the use of tools like templates or checklists. Participants discussed specifying "completing a reporting checklist" as a target behaviour, but decided against it as previous research showed that authors who complete checklists upon submission don't necessarily edit their manuscript or comply with guidelines. Participants also recognised that focussing on checklists may be problematic because checklists appear administrative, are used _after_ a manuscript has been written, at which point authors are least able or motivated to edit their work. Nevertheless, participants recognised that checklists will continue to be an important part of how reporting guidance are disseminated, and so they are included within the term "apply the guidance", without being named.

We felt it important to specify that guidance should be applied "as intended by the guideline developer" as my previous research showed that sometimes authors who misinterpret guidelines may believe that they are adhering when they are not.

Hence our target behaviour definition specifies the _who_, _what_, and _when_ but is broad enough to account for differences between researchers' working practices, research projects, and reporting guidelines.

This was a useful starting point because it made us aware of what we were _not_ focussing on and helped us identify when we were drifting too far from this focus. For example, we purposefully selected _authors_ and although we did still talk about _peer reviewers_ and _editors_ it was only because their behaviour influences the behaviour of authors, and we were aware that their behaviour was "further away" from our true target.

## Identifying what needs to change and identifying behavioural drivers

Sign post that step 4 is reported in focus group chapter, and that 5, 6, (7?) and 8 are in the redesign chapter.

## Added stage - idea generation

By the end of the fourth stage of the BCW approach we had defined our target behaviour and identified what may influence this behaviour (see chapters {{< var chapters.synthesis >}}-{{< var chapters.journal-audit >}}). In discussing these influences, workshop members naturally suggested ideas to address them. Documenting these ideas seemed sensible.

The fifth stage of the BCW approach asks you prioritise intervention functions. Workshop participants were not familiar with behavioural science and so didn't understand many of the terms. Generating examples of each intervention function was a useful way for workshop members to understand them.

Because workshop members were contributing ideas spontaneously - as a natural part of discussion and as way of better understanding barriers and intervention functions - I decided to take a systematic approach to idea generation.

#TODO: methods


## Identifying IFs - see focus group chapter

## Identifying Policy Categories etc

We used the same technique for worksheets 6 to 8. (Same method as Worksheet 5 in focus group chapter).

### General notes

My EQUATOR colleagues found the exercise incredibly useful and motivating. For years, the refrain had been that journal enforcement was the only solution. But by the end of the workshops, not only had the team thought of many other strategies, but journal enforcement was now seen as less of a priority and, for some reporting guidelines at least, even undesirable. More fundamentally, the process got everybody thinking about reporting guidelines not just as a set of documents or standards, but as a complex behaviour change intervention.

The hardest step may have been the third worksheet: selecting our target behaviour. With the behaviour of authors, editors, peer reviewers, and funders so intertwined, and given the variation reporting guideline content and how they are used, specifying a single target behaviour required us to reflect and dissect EQUATOR UK's objectives.

Here is the behavioural specification we ended up with:

<!-- #TODO: insert behavioural specification -->

We followed worksheets 1-4 verbatim. Worksheet 4 asks you to identify what needs to change and to categorize these changes into the underlying behavioural driver from the COM-B model. For instance "authors need to know what reporting guidelines are" would be a change under _capability_. "Authors need to be able to access reporting guidelines" would be an _opportunity_ change. My thematic synthesis, survey review, website review and audit provided evidence for many changes, and EQUATOR members contributed their own thoughts based on personal experience.
