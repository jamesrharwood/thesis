In their book (@michieBehaviourChangeWheel2014), Michie et al. provide worksheets that guide you through the process of defining the behaviour you are interested, diagnosing barriers in terms of the underlying behavioural drivers, and selecting intervention components. Specifically, these worksheets help you:

1. define the problem in behavioural terms,
2. identify which behaviours could bring about the desired change and selecting one to focus on,
3. specify the chosen target behaviour in terms of who needs to do what, when, where, how often, and with whom,
4. identify what needs to change in order for the target behaviour to occur, and categorize these changes according to their underlying behavioural drivers (from COM-B),
5. identify which intervention functions you could use,
6. identify which policy categories you could use,
7. identify behaviour change techniques (from a taxonomy) based on the intervention functions chosen identified in step 5 and,
8. identify modes of delivery (e.g. face-to-face, internet, mobile app etc.).

I worked through these steps on my own to get a feel for the BCW and whether it could help and to reflect on my own beliefs and ideas. Once familiar, I was able to lead workshops with {{< var counts.EQUATOR_staff >}} members of the UK EQUATOR Centre to go through the process again. 

The EQUATOR team met {{< var counts.EQUATOR_meetings >}} times between December 2021 and May 2022, with each meeting lasting around 2 hours. I would ask everyone to consider the worksheets on their own or in pairs before discussing as a group. Everybody could edit the worksheets, which were shared over Microsoft Teams, but usually only one person acted as a scribe. I withheld my own ideas until the end of a session or task, whereupon others could discuss them and add them to the document if desired. Most of my ideas came from my familiarity with the literature or from my experience as a software developer, and contributing them at such an early stage meant that EQUATOR staff and future focus group members could interrogate, modify and disagree with them. 

My EQUATOR colleagues found the exercise incredibly useful and motivating. For years, the refrain had been that journal enforcement was the only solution. But by the end of the workshops, not only had the team thought of many other strategies, but journal enforcement was now seen as less of a priority and, for some reporting guidelines at least, even undesirable. More fundamentally, the process got everybody thinking about reporting guidelines not just as a set of documents or standards, but as a complex behaviour change intervention. 

The hardest step may have been the third worksheet: selecting our target behaviour. With the behaviour of authors, editors, peer reviewers, and funders so intertwined, and given the variation reporting guideline content and how they are used, specifying a single target behaviour required us to reflect and dissect EQUATOR UK's objectives.

Here is the behavioural specification we ended up with:

<!-- #TODO: insert behavioural specification -->

This was a useful starting point because it made us aware of what we were _not_ focussing on and helped us identify when we were drifting too far from this focus. For example, we purposefully selected _authors_ and although we did still talk about _peer reviewers_ and _editors_ it was only because their behaviour influences the behaviour of authors, and we were aware that their behaviour was "further away" from our true target.

We followed worksheets 1-4 verbatim. Worksheet 4 asks you to identify what needs to change and to categorize these changes into the underlying behavioural driver from the COM-B model. For instance "authors need to know what reporting guidelines are" would be a change under _capability_. "Authors need to be able to access reporting guidelines" would be an _opportunity_ change. My thematic synthesis, survey review, website review and audit provided evidence for many changes, and EQUATOR members contributed their own thoughts based on personal experience.

## Identifying IFs - see focus group chapter

## Identifying Policy Categories etc

We used the same technique for worksheets 6 to 8. (Same method as Worksheet 5 in focus group chapter).
