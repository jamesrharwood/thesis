## Introduction

In chapter {{< var chapters.workshops >}} I described how I led reporting guideline experts from the EQUATOR UK Centre through the stages recommended in Michie et al.'s book "The Behaviour Change Wheel - A Guide to Designing Interventions" @michieBehaviourChangeWheel2014. This guide helped us define our target behaviour, identify {{< var counts.barriers >}} things that had to change for our target behaviour to occur, and to prioritise lists of intervention functions, policy categories, possible behaviour change techniques, and delivery options. However, these lists were abstract and still had to be _actualised_. For instance, although we had prioritised _Restructuring the physical environment_ as a possible behaviour change technique, _how_ could the environment be restructured? Similarly, we prioritised Enablement, Persuasion, or Education, but _how_ and _where_ could these functions be applied? We had vague notions that redesigning reporting guidelines, the EQUATOR website, developing new guidance and communication campaigns might be useful, but no tangible plans.

Thus my next objective was to gather concrete ideas on how these abstract concepts could be realised to address reporting guideline limitations. In chapter {{< var chapters.workshops >}} I explained how I began this process with EQUATOR staff as part of step 7 of the workshops, when I asked them to consider how we could use our preferred intervention functions to address influences. This was an opportunity to invite input from broader stakeholders. Although EQUATOR is a key part of the reporting guideline landscape, they are _only_ a part of it. Ultimately, all stakeholders within the academic system influence the impact of reporting guidelines. Guideline developers and publishers arguably do so most directly, and so it was important to draw on their experience and opinions. It hadn't been feasible to include these stakeholders through all stages of the Behaviour Change Wheel approach as the time commitment was too great, and it would have required stakeholders to become familiar with the framework and its terminologies which was too big an ask. In contrast, brainstorming ideas was a convenient and important stage to include them in. I expected that seeking input from a more diverse group would lead to _more_ ideas and that those ideas would be more likely to gain traction.

In this chapter I explain how I went through this brainstorming process by 1) running workshops with EQUATOR staff members and 2) running focus groups with other stakeholders before describing the combined results.
