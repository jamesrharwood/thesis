**Techniques for establishing credibility**|
*Member-checking*|Lincoln and Guba argue that member checking is the most important way to the establish validity of an account @lincolnNaturalisticInquiry1985. Accordingly, I invited participants to comment on my synthesised results, asking for feedback on the structure of categories, my interpretation of their data, and my findings and conclusions. I also invited participants to comment on the product of my data analysis in the form of itemized information and condensed notes.
*Peer debriefing*|Throughout the design, data collection, analysis and reporting, Charlotte Albury acted as a disinterested peer. By questioning my reasoning and exploring my assumptions, she helped me become aware of biases, perspectives I was taking for granted, and assumptions I was making. Jennifer de Beyer acted as a disinterested peer during data analysis.
**Techniques for establishing transferability**|
*Thick description*|I aspired to report my results with context by indicating when ideas were common or rare, and who they originated from when I felt this was particularly relevant. I reported disagreements, provide quotes, and relationships between ideas.
**Techniques for establishing confirmability**|
*Audit trail*|I referred to audio recordings of the focus groups whenever I needed to clarify parts of the document. I kept versions of raw data collected from all stages. I made a note of my own ideas before commencing data collection, documented all stages of the workshops I held internally with the EQUATOR Network, and kept copies of the co-produced file after every focus group. I kept a copy of my coding in NVivo, and versions of the unitized information and summaries that I sent to participants before and after member checking. This audit trail meant that I could be certain of which stages of research ideas originated from.
*Reflexivity*|I wrote down my own ideas before commencing the study (see chapter {{< var chapters.workshops >}}), along with my beliefs and experiences of reporting guidelines. I continued to keep personal notes throughout planning, data collection, analysis and reporting, in an attempt to remain aware of my own perspectives and positions, and how they may influence my research.
