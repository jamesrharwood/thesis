<p>I recruited participants between 21/03/2023 until 9/08/2023. The number of people expressing interest, eligible, consenting, and participating and shown in <a href="#tbl-interview-recruitment">Table&nbsp;1</a>, as are the reasons for drop out. Eleven people participated. Two dropped out before the second interview, without giving a reason. Participants’ characteristics are summarized in <a href="#tbl-interview-participants">Table&nbsp;2</a> and included variety in research experience (from 1 to 10+ years), subject area, country of origin, first language, and experience in using reporting guidelines. Six participants had never heard of reporting guidelines before. One had, but did not remember which one they had used. Three participants had used a reporting guideline before, and one had used many reporting guidelines before. The first interview lasted between 45 minutes - 1.5 hours, and the second interview lasted 30-45 minutes.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="design-iterations">Design Iterations</h3>
<p>I had originally planned to finish data collection before making any changes to the website. However, the first five participants consistently mentioned similar deficiencies. After reflecting and discussing with UK EQUATOR staff, we agreed these deficiencies would likely affect many authors and diminish the website’s success, and so we decided to iterate our design.</p>
<p>Briefly, the changes we made included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Editing the text at the top of the home page for clarity and to emphasise benefits.</li>
<li>Adding images to home page to make the page more attractive and to convey meaning of accompany text.</li>
<li>Addition of publisher logos to foster trust</li>
<li>Reorganisation of the introduction to SRQR to make it appear shorter.</li>
</ul>
<p>The results below include quotes and discussion pertaining to these changes.</p>
</section>
<section id="main-findings" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="main-findings">Main findings</h3>
<p>I identified deficiencies. Table <a href="#tbl-deficiencies-by-component">Table&nbsp;3</a> shows deficiencies, quotes, and codes, for each intervention component. I have chosen to describe a few deficiencies in more detail, either because I deemed them important, they were frequently mentioned, or involved interactions between components.</p>
<section id="var-intervention-components.describe-what-rgs-are.title" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="var-intervention-components.describe-what-rgs-are.title"><strong>?var:intervention-components.describe-what-rgs-are.title</strong></h4>
<p><em>Relevant website features: <strong>?var:intervention-components.describe-what-rgs-are.description</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Barriers addressed: <strong>?var:intervention-components.describe-what-rgs-are.barriers</strong></em></p>
<p>Because it is important that future website visitor website visitors quickly realise that the site contains resources for <em>writing up</em> research articles, as opposed to <em>designing</em> or <em>appraising</em> studies, I used the 5 second test to explore what participants understood the website to be about upon first impression. This was the first time participants saw the website. Before then, they had no idea what it would be about.</p>
<p><strong>On immediate impression, some participants quickly realised the website was about writing, but some did not, or thought it was about methodological guidelines</strong></p>
<p>All participants realised the website was about research. Some researchers realised the website was about writing within 5 seconds:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“From what I have seen, I think probably the website should be about, uh, helping you try to discover….identify the guidelines that you will use for writing your study quickly.” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-BH</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“how to go about writing something” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-SK</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, other participants gleaned only vague understandings like “support for doing research” (<strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-JZ</strong>) or “guidelines of some sorts, I think in relation to research” (<strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-OMK</strong>), and one expected the website to be about methodological guidance:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“methodology guidelines one can use or follow when conducting research” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-VS</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Participants with previous experience using reporting checklists recognized that the website might be about reporting guidelines:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Well, I hadn’t seen the the guide that I’m familiar with (that is the COREQ). But I think the other guides also are like COREQ. So that’s what comes to my mind. So I think it’s a [website] where you are going to find all the checklists or the guides for all the […] final stages of the research when we are, like, writing the paper, just to […] double check that everything has been included.” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-MJ</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“That’s the EQUATOR guidelines, so that’s… consensus… expert consensus-developed guidelines for the reporting of different research.” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-HA</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“[I read that] you can use reporting guidelines to try and help you [write research articles] more efficiently or quickly. And then I was thinking about, what the heck are reporting guidelines? And then I think it might be stuff like STROBE or like those checklists things or PRISMA, if you’re doing a systematic review or something. And that’s all I got” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-CW</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given a few more seconds to explore the website on their own (during the think aloud task), all participants realised that the guidelines were for writing and others gained more insight into what to expect from reporting guidelines.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“after reading this sentence I think you want to give me a framework, a framework about writing. Is that right?”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I think the guideline would, uh, would clearly state the different sections of the research report or the manuscript and then whatever is required under a section like maybe under methods. Like what are the nitty gritties required under method.” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-BH</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some participants found later, longer form descriptions more informative. Referring to content half way down the landing page, one participant said:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Why couldn’t this be further up? Why can’t that be at the top and then the that stuff here follow? Because then I’d have a better idea of what this is about.[…] I would have liked to have read this at the top and I would have known straight away what this whole website was about.” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-CW</strong></p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section id="var-intervention-components.design-trust.title" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="var-intervention-components.design-trust.title"><strong>?var:intervention-components.design-trust.title</strong></h4>
<p><em>Relevant website features: <strong>?var:intervention-components.design-trust.description</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Barriers addressed: <strong>?var:intervention-components.design-trust.barriers</strong></em></p>
<p>When participants talked about trust, they mentioned whether the website appeared professional, credible, and believable. This intervention component is complex because content and design throughout the entire website influenced judgements regarding trust. In particular, participants wanted to know who made the website and why they could be trusted, and identified some design elements that could look more professional.</p>
<p><strong>EQUATOR’s introduction could be more prominent</strong></p>
<p>Apart from its logo, EQUATOR is not mentioned at the top of the page. Participants who did know about EQUATOR said that its brand lent credibility:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“and then I picked up the top my top left hand corner with the EQUATOR logo so it seemed from reputable source.” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-VS</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I already trust the website because I saw that… like this is legit and I see the credentials from EQUATOR network” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-MJ</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Participants unfamiliar with EQUATOR expressed wanting to know who developed the website. Whilst looking at the top of the home page, one participant said:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I really don’t get an idea of […] who’s responsible for the website […] would I trust the the developers of the website?” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-OMK</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The EQUATOR Network is introduced towards the bottom of the home page. Participants recommended moving this introduction (or parts of it) up to the top, using an updated photo, and adding EQUATOR’s affiliations and awards.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“So most places put the the <em>about</em> stuff at the bottom and I would have liked to have seen what [EQUATOR stands for] explained right at the top.” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-CW</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“And then this is the thing on the bottom that I want to look at on every website… because I want to see if they have an actual office. So usually I click this”about us” first” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-RW</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Participant: Oh, so this is your mission. So here my question is <em>What is this group? What is EQUATOR?</em> So this is my first question because from my background, which is not from medicine, I’m not very familiar with this group. So I want to know what is this and the second feeling I have, I think I might want to see this information at the very first beginning…I want to know who this website is created by? Because I want to use a professional website, so I think the reason I read this paragraph is I want to find some evidence to prove that your group is very professional. Interviewer: Mmm. Participant: Well, maybe you can put [the section about EQUATOR] at the very first beginning and provide a little description about what the group is about, what it is, and what are those people where do they come from something like this.” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-JZ</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I also did some research with my Chinese colleagues and sometimes some prestigious university’s logo will add trust, yeah.” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-YD</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I think sometimes it is useful […] to put some awards here. Just to make people think you are trustworthy.” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-JZ</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The site’s design could be more professional</strong></p>
<p>A design intention was to make the website appear simple. The first iteration was apparently <em>too</em> simple and one participant explained how its simplicity made it less trustworthy:</p>
<p>“it looks kind of like a blog […] it’s a basic website” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-RW</strong></p>
<p>“I wouldn’t say [it looks] partically trustworthy, but not particularly suspicious either. Kind of in the middle […] something that will be more trustworthy will be something which is more sophisticated because I know, ‘OK, this is someone who actually took his time to do a lot of work… put a lot of work in designing it’. Most of the time if it is a fake website, it’s usually much more simple.” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-WH</strong></p>
<p>One participant viewed both the first and second iterations of the home page (their second interview session occurred after the iteration), and they described the second iteration as better because “It’s like more trustable […] Scientific. Evidence based. Yeah, of course, legit.” Others decribed the second iteration as “clean” and “uncluttered” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-HA</strong>, “straightforward” and “open” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-BH</strong>, and even as “calming” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-VS</strong>.</p>
<p>However, one participant still questioned the second iteration simplicity and trustworthiness, and drew a comparison with another website that she <em>did</em> trust:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“So I’m saying it’s kind of basic, that the format itself is kind of basic […] [When] I’m looking for information on PUB Med, just the outlet itself gives you the picture that, you know, somehow you can trust it. You know it looks as if there was more work put in it.” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-OMK</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Logos lend credibility and could be more prominent</strong></p>
<p>Participants noticed that the first iteration had no logos:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I don’t know if this is just me, but I kinda want some logos. So I know who will vouch for [the website] right away. Like, usually […] there’s some, like, other medical societies that are, like,”We we are on the EQUATOR network” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-RW</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Inspired by these comments, we added logos to the second iteration home page to show publishers endorsing reporting guidelines. All participants liked these, but some suggested they could appear at the top of the home page so they are immediately visible.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Leading publishers….Wow, this is good…Nature. Really? Elsevier, BMJ. Yes, this is good. And this brings some sense of trust and authenticity in the website.” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-BH</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“[The publishers’ logos are] encouraging, because these are all publishing houses with mostly reputable journals, probably all reputable journals. […] You know, if these were higher up, then […] that would have made me feel a little bit more like ohh, this is good.” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-CW</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Reporting guideline endorsements and citations lend credibility, but may not be intuitive</strong></p>
<p>The top of the SRQR guideline page included widgets displaying the number of journal endorsements, and the number of times the reporting guideline had been cited. Some people commented that this information lent credibility:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I think it is authentic. It’s robust. If it was endorsed by many journals and developed by experienced researchers, if I use it, maybe I’ll get a better quality work.” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-BH</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I think citations here might be some people or some people’s work who has cited this page. So this this button […] might show people how many other words use this page.” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-JZ</strong>”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“…understand […] that the SRQR guidelines is something that’s already widely used.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I didn’t pay attention before, but I think I like it (the citation information) […] if it is more cited, I think, like, I will believe it. I will believe it, like, much better, and also like the journal endorsements” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-YD</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, not everybody understood what these numbers meant.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Is this [widget] telling me [something], or is it what I am supposed to click on?” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-OMK</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I was a bit confused there, OK” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-OMK</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I think the citation tab over here… What is the relevance of it? I mean, why I’m seeing that?” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-SK</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Others were not sure whether the citation information pertained to the website or an underlying article.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I’m not sure if [it is about], you know, the website or connected paper.” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-JZ</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Has it been cited 4000 times? I don’t understand that.” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-CW</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Not everybody considered the image at the top of the home page to be trustworthy</strong></p>
<p>For the second iteration, I added an image to the top of the home page comprising of three icons to represent the process of writing a manuscript. On participant described this image as a “bit naff […] I actually think this [image] reduces [the website’s] score on the first impressions of trustworthiness kind of thing. Just because [the icons making up the image] are so, umm, ubiquitous, and, uh cheap?” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-HA</strong></p>

<section id="var-intervention-components.describe-benefits.title" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="var-intervention-components.describe-benefits.title"><strong>?var:intervention-components.describe-benefits.title</strong></h4>
<p><em>Relevant website features: <strong>?var:intervention-components.describe-benefits.description</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Barriers addressed: <strong>?var:intervention-components.describe-benefits.barriers</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Benefits are clear, but could be communicated quicker</strong></p>
<p>We wanted website visitors to immediately expect the website to benefit them as researchers and authors. The website headline is one of the first things visitors see, and so was an important feature for communicating benefits. In the first iteration the heading was <em>“Research articles, made simple”</em>, but participants thought this was about <em>reading</em> or <em>explaining</em> research articles. In the second iteration, we changed this heading to <em>“Want help writing up research?”</em>.</p>
<p>All participants talked about benefits or help. None talked about the opposite (e.g., rules, requirements, or red tape). In the 5 second test, some of these descriptions were vague:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I see research and writing. So i’m thinking. This is to help me with something with my job.” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-RW</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“so it’s going to assist me in research. It’s going to help me somehow. Make things easier for me.” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-MJ</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under the headline, we included a short statement: <em>‘reporting guidelines help you describe research quickly, confidently in completely’</em>. Two participants did not find this brief text meaningful in the five second test:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I tried to read the sub headline just below the biggest one and it says help you blah blah confidently and blah blah. […] So I think this information maybe be meaningless for me […] because it sounds like it didn’t provide some concrete information. It’s just a sentence that tried to cheer me up.” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-JZ</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“And then there’s something to do with <em>‘reporting guidelines help you describe research quickly, confidently in completely’</em>. This information is not really telling me much” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-OMK</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, they seemed to understand the reported benefits after reading the top of the home page in more detail, and after vieweing the section below where benefits are stated more clearly (e.g.,). Similarly, other participants began to understand the benefits and link them to their own experiences as authors.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“OK, I think this part is very great because when I when I see something like <em>”easy writing”</em>, <em>”smoother publishing”</em> I think <em>”Ohh, that’s great. That’s what I want.”</em>” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-JZ</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Participant: Now I’m getting a sense of what the website is about. Now looking at the things down here…</p>
<p>Interviewer: OK.</p>
<p>Participant: I’m getting that might be a useful resource. That actually, umm, because these areas I think for… early career researchers like me, I’d say I’d be very interested to come in and see this.” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-OMK</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Participants seemed to understand how reporting guidelines might make publishing “smoother”.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“it gives me an impression that maybe this website will help me write my work easily and it will also help me increase the chance of my work getting published” - <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-BH</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Umm, just aligning myself to this standard that already many people use. And hopefully, In doing that, I’ll be up to standard and then I won’t stress myself too much later.” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-BH</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Making a distinction between benefits to authors and readers may lead to confusion about the intended user</strong></p>
<p>Further down the home page, the section title <em>‘Helping authors and readers’</em> made one participant expect the website to also host resources for readers.</p>
<p>“So this is a bit weird. So is the point here that this one is for the writers. And now it’s saying, OK, but we can also help readers. OK, I suppose that’s interesting.” PPT-CW</p>
<p><strong>The images depicting benefits could be clearer</strong></p>
<p>One participant said the icons describing writing and impact were appropriate (a blank page and an award, respectively), but the image depicting “smoother publishing” was not intuitive.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“looking at that icon, it doesn’t really tell me anything about smoother [publishing].” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-HA</strong></p>

<p>“If any of these things: <em>writing research</em>, <em>checking manuscripts</em> and <em>planning research</em>, if these can be consolidated on [the top of] your landing page somewhere […] it might might be beneficial because my thought process is that I need to know what I’m doing and only then reporting guidelines can help me, right? So if I know that this website gonna help me with writing the manuscripts, checking […] I think then, reporting guidelines can make a logical progression in that particular case?” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-SK</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Using a reporting guideline “for planning” was not intuitive</strong></p>
<p>The home page instructed that reporting guidelines can be used when planning research, but will not dictate design decisions. The SRQR page had a button to download a “log book” where researchers could document the decisions and data they would later need to report. However, no participants understood what this log book might be:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“it’s not immediately intuitive what a log book might be” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-BH</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“OK, what’s a log book? Don’t know.” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-CW</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“nothing has been mentioned about the log book overhead. How [am I] gonna use the log book? Maybe you have mentioned about the template checklist, but uh, maybe we can add [something about] the log book.” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-SK</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The word “planning” was not intuitive either. One thought this meant planning a manuscript, and so confused the purpose of the log book with that of the template. Another interpreted it as guidance for writing a research proposal.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“When I when I’m reading planning research, I think maybe I have already done this when I design my own outline.” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-JZ</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“To write can help you plan a study. Yeah, I guess it’s… I I would have thought this might be useful if you’re writing a research grant or a research proposal.” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-VS</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had ordered the tasks and tools as “drafting”, “checking” and then “planning”. I put planning at the end because it is the least conventional way to use a reporting guidelines. Some participants questioned this ordering:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Why is planning at the end? You have to plan first before you write.” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-CW</strong></p>

<p><strong>Many participants said they wanted more, varied examples</strong></p>
<p>Each reporting item in SRQR comes with one or more examples from published literature. All participants stressed the usefulness of these examples. The attention examples received was notable because I did not ask about them; all comments about examples came spontaneously from the participant in the think aloud and plus minus tasks.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Oh, and you have examples that could be really helpful, yeah.” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-MJ</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“the most important thing I would say is the examples” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-BH</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I found [this section] very useful as they give more detailed explanations on each specific section, and particularly the examples.” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-WH</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, many participants said they wanted more examples, and greater variation in style, length, and conciseness.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“need further explanation and examples” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-BH</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“it would would have been useful or helpful for me to to have more than just one example.” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-OMK</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“illustrations of how to [report] this information in a concise manner, that would be very helpful as well.” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-OMK</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“you may as well put a whole discussion in there, or at least just sort of three or four paragraph discussion” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-CW</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“And here if there could be more examples, because when I […] started to read through and understand the the PRISMA guidelines and use the official explanation file to try to understand exactly what I’m required to write about and the examples particularly helped me a lot.” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-WH</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many participants wanted examples from their own field, or even entire publications that have used the guideline:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“So I want something more relatable, [because] when I was reading these examples they were not relevant to my work.” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-CW</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“…if you can list some […] papers who use the SRQR, you can put it here.” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-JZ</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I’ve searched and pubmed to find an example of a research article that’s used these standards so I could copy or check how they’ve laid it out, which subheadings they’ve used.” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-CW</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Citations may be less credible if they are old or not referenced</strong></p>
<p>In the original SRQR publication, all examples are referenced. I had not included references for the examples when putting them onto the website because of time constraints. This bothered one participant.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Well, there’s no references there, so is that a very good example? No, I don’t know the source of these things. […] You know, I don’t know, where did it come from? Where’s the reference?” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-CW</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I asked about hypothetically labelling examples as fake if they were made up, the participant said “Yeah, I guess that would be alright”.</p>
<p>The same participant also noted that an example was quite old (10 years).</p>
<p><strong>Citations could be more useful if explained or annotated</strong></p>
<p>Because some reporting items contain multiple sub-items, one participant said annotating examples may be helpful. Taking a discussion item about transferability and integrating findings, they suggested “if you could underline or maybe indicate [in the example] that <em>this</em> [sentence] is now how they are trying to say the result can be transferable, umm, this is another [sentence] trying to say how they’re trying to integrate…. something like that.” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-BH</strong></p>

<p>Some complex words in the redesigned SRQR guideline had blue dotted lines underneath. When participants clicked them, a definition would pop up. Participants stressed usefulness of this feature, and everybody liked that the definitions appeared in a popup, and not on a new page.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Participants wanted more definitions within the guidance (some struggled with words like “transferability” or “generalizability”) and other areas of the website. For example, when reading about the scope of SRQR and related guidelines, participants struggled to understand terms like “qualitative evidence synthesis”</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“A qualitative evidence synthesis. What’s that? Is that like a review?” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-CW</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When reading a list of guidelines for different study types on the home page, one participant explained how not understanding terms like “cohort study” led her to feel anxious and worried.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Actually, I feel a little anxious because I’m not sure whether it shows that I am not good at something or I am ignorant or something.

</blockquote>
<p><strong>User experience might be clearer if definitions were signified by a different colour (not blue)</strong></p>
<p>Because I wanted to know whether future users would discover this functionality by themselves, I asked participants what they expected the dotted lines to signify. Most participants guessed correctly.</p>

<p><strong>Participants liked having extra content as notes, but footnotes might not be optimal implementation</strong></p>
<p>When an SRQR item contained extra context or explanation not relevant to all users, I moved this into a note. I wa not sure of the best way to implement notes.</p>
<p>I tried footnotes, but participants expected the footnote identifiers (superscript numbers) to be references, and did not like how reading the footnote took them to the bottom of the page, away from where they had been reading:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I think it’s a citation. So uh linked to a reference. But I think it may also be foot note.” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-VS</strong></p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">

<p>The redesigned SRQR guideline has a side navigation menu so users can easily navigate to the Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion guidance sections, or to the FAQs and citation information. A few participants did not notice the menu, or suggested it could be more prominent, and one suggested it would be useful if the menu listed all reporting items.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“when I scrolling I forgot to pay attention to the menu on the side. So […] I suddenly realized it was a menu there […] Maybe make it much more, like, the characters larger or, like, the colour, maybe change it, because now it is so light and I didn’t pay attention to that. But this menu is useful if I pay attention to this.” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-YD</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each reporting item has its own menu so users can jump to the item’s justification, examples, or related resources. The same participant described these item menus as a useful way to help “find the detailed part” they desired.</p>
<p><strong>Section URLs could be more intuitive</strong></p>
<p>When the mouse hovers above a reporting item heading, a button would appear to allow users to a copy the URL to that specific section. One participant did not find this intuitive, and thought the button would take them to more information instead.</p>
<p><strong>Participants may desire a summary of the guidance</strong></p>
<p>In the think aloud, one participant said they would prefer to browse the checklist above the full guidance because “in my head, like the checklist probably has these things already” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-RW</strong>, and expected the checklist to act as a summary. This expectation may explain why another participant said “I just want to see what this thing is and at the moment I don’t know. Should I read the guidelines or checklist?”, perhaps because they desired an overview <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-CW</strong>.</p>
<p>“So maybe not the full guideline, but I’m not sure how how you can present it. Maybe one paragraph, or, uh, or you could present a mind map. Maybe you can present a mind map and you can put the keywords of this guideline. So if people want to see, for example, […] introduction, literature review, methodology, blah blah.

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“So I think this explanation here is very clear that it helps searches to know that definitely they can have their own ideas and this guideline is it is kind of like a a supporting one but not the but not a rule, not a standardized rule.” <strong>?var:pilot.participants.PPT-JZ</strong></p>

<pre><code>Thirteen intervention components received only one mention, or no comments at all. 

Three of these were purposefully not tested: none of the methods I used were targeting that component and I did not ask about it in the semi structured interview. 

For # others, it was good that nobody mentioned them. For example, 

* Some were not tested
* For some, it is good that they were not mentioned (e.g., avoid judgmental language or)
* For others, might be because they were not prominent (either on purpose or by accident)</code></pre>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="barriers">Barriers</h4>
<p>Participants naturally discussed barriers and facilitators they encountered when applying guidance, either during this study or in their previous experience. I had identified many of these factors in my previous work (chapters . Barriers that were mentioned independently of the website being studied included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not having known what reporting guidelines were earlier in their career</li>
<li>Feeling frustrated when asked to use a reporting guideline or checklist when they have already finalised their manuscript and are submitting to a journal.</li>
<li>(previously) finding the checklist, but not the full guidance</li>
<li>Being limited by journal requirements and word limits</li>
<li>struggling to keep writing concise and fluid</li>
<li>needing more guidance</li>
<li>being unable to report an item because it is their colleague’s responsibility, or because they hadn’t done what was being asked when designing their study or collecting data.</li>
<li>paywalls</li>
</ul>
<p>Participants also mentioned facilitators that were not addressed by the website:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using reporting guidelines for teaching students</li>
<li>Wanting guidance for funding applications</li>
<li>Funders enforcing reporting guidelines</li>
</ul>
<p>However, participants also mentioned some new barriers that I had not identified previously. These included:</p>
<ul>
<li>When guideline author names appear Western, some (non western) participants expected the guidance to be less relevant to them.</li>
<li>When a guideline is described as “version 1.0”, this might make people feel like the guidance is (too) new, and therefore less trustable.</li>
<li>the loading speed of websites (which was not an issue for this one)</li>
<li>not understanding reviewer feedback</li>
<li>not wanting to read on a screen</li>
<li>not understanding the relationship between the EQUATOR Network and the guidelines or guideline developers.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="comparisons-between-the-website-being-tested-and-the-old-equator-website-guideline-publications.">Comparisons between the website being tested and the old EQUATOR website &amp; guideline publications.</h4>
<pre><code>This happened organically. One participant had used a guideline before and wanted to retrace their steps to show me which one. Two others wanted to continue using reporting guidelines in the future and asked me where they could be found. Some others spontaneously reflected on their previous experience.

Responses upon viewing EQUATOR's old website included:

* confusion
* negative reactions

When I asked one participant to find the SRQR guidance using EQUATOR's old website it took her 8 minutes, during which she gave up twice. A second participant managed it a few minutes faster, but in the end, both managed to find the checklist within the SRQR publication, but neither found the full guidance (which is a supplement). 

One participant (PPT-CW) said In session 1 that they would prefer to get the publication directly. So they went to pubmed and upon reading the sentence in the abstract (where it mentions "The authors define and explain key elements of each item and provide examples" #REF) said "So this is this is the stuff that you know that I want to know". They worried they would not be able to access the article if it was paywalled because they were working from home. However, from there, they ran intro trouble. First, they struggled to find the button to download the article as a PDF "I get irritated because I can't see where I can download the PDF". They then hunted for the guidance within the manuscript: "So in the interest of time, I would skim read all of [the article], and I don't really care what they did to come up with it....I don't care about the discussion". Eventually, two minutes after opening the article, they found the checklist table and stopped searching. They did not find the full guidance (which is in a supplementary file). Because the checklist did not include examples (these are in the supplement) they were forced to "look at the reference list to see if there was potentially an example paper" or to "go back to Pub Med and search for an article that used these guidelines". 

Another participant tried to find the original SRQR guidance because she wanted to continue using the guideline after the study finished. She started on the EQUATOR Network home page. On first impression, she felt the home page looked "full" and "rich". I then observed as she tried to find the SRQR guidance from the EQUATOR home page without assistance. After two minutes, they had managed to search for the word "qualitative" but were stuck on the search results page. "I wanted qualitative researcher guidance.
I don't know what the rest of this is...I am confused." She gave up at this point, so I told her where to click to reach SRQR's entry on EQUATOR's database page. After another minute, they were unsure where to click next, and ended up "go[ing] back in this point and see if I missed something." Giving up again, I told them where to click to access the SRQR publication. After accessing the article, they were "expecting to find the guidance down there" (below the Methods). After 8 minutes and giving up twice, the participant never found the checklist nor the full guidance. 

Another participant (PPT-SK) also asked to see the original publication. When comparing the publication with the website they said "Your website is actually making [the guidance] a bit more precise and to the point, right? I don't need the other details over here [referring to the background, methods, and discussion of the publication] when I want the SRQR guidelines, right? So your website is doing, in fact, a good job here." When I showed them the original SRQR full guidance (the supplement), they said:

"Participant: That's too heavy on the content.

Interviewer: So if if the option was between this this version that you're looking at now [the supplement] and the the website that you saw first, which do you think you prefer to use?

Participant: I think [the website] is far better than the [supplement]. Yeah, this one [the website] is far better."

Another participant (PPT-VS) had used the EQUATOR Network website before and wanted to retrace their steps. Upon seeing the old website, they described it as "boring", saying "the colours just look, like, outdated. It looks quite text heavy."

Recounting their previous experience, they said, "Not that long ago I went on to the site because I was looking to complete a reporting checklist and it seemed clear to find the checklist that I wanted. But when I went through the checklist, it wasn't appropriate. And then I just ended up feeling a bit unsure about what it is, which was the best one to go for."

Another participant reflected on their previous experience of using the PRISMA guidelines and explanation document. They said:

"I rather prefer this form [the website] of guidance than the other one. There can be a lot more information that are being presented in this way. Information which... you know... the fact that you can choose to extend, choose to follow the link or not. For example [...] I don't need so much about the title, all I need is this and this [the instructions of what to describe] to be familiar with the title so that's fine I don't need to open this [the drop down content]. And then the abstract. Maybe I need more information on the abstract. I can use the different links and this drop down menu here. I I think that's useful. That's better because it it's more (how can I say?) well presented.
Well presented, well laid out, so that where I need to go deeper, I can go easily. Where I need just surface information or the parts that I'm already familiar with, I can just scroll through and continue to move and stuff. Plus I think nearly all the information that the other the document, like the PRISMA elaboration and explanation document all, nearly all of them can be put into a page like this with without having to, you know, make the page too bulky. Presenting it even in a better way. So I think I'll prefer something presented in this way than the than the document that I read".

MJ said of EQUATOR's website "Ohh no I I didn't like it. The [new] one is much, much better." They elaborated that they found the website to look more trsutworthy, more organised, and they preferred the font and colours. However, they did like the coloured boxes on the old website. 

HA - as an experienced reporting guideline user, they remembered liking that the old website had short cut links to frequently accessed reporting guidelines. </code></pre>
