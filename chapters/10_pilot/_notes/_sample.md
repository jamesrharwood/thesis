## Sample size

Purposive

Seeking variance. I want to include varying experiences, backgrounds, english proficiencies etc. But I don't want to do any kind of formal comparison. Just use variation to aid interpretation & because I think it will lead to identification of more problems.

Learn as collecting data. If we find more reasons for difficulty then should sample more.

### Information power:

#### Study Aim: Broad vs Narrow?

We could make ours more narrow by narrowing the question to e.g., early career researchers or a particular guideline.

Given that experience was one dimension that was flagged, is that sensible?

Sample specificity: Dense or sparse? Specificity means participants who belong to the specified target group whilst also exhibiting some variation within the experiences to be explored.
<!-- # ASK: I don't understand specificity -->

Established theory - applied or not? We are using BCW and COM-B as our established theory. Or at least we did, but will we use it again? I think so...?

Quality of Dialogue - Strong or Weak? We can strengthen it by using tasks, think-aloud, observation, diary, and retrospective interviews. I'd hope to get good quality dialogue from every participant.

Analysis Strategy - Case or Cross-Case? My gut says to keep this as a Case analysis. Not to include EQUATOR website (which I think would make it cross case). Charlotte says I am doing Cross Case. 


Notes

NB If we are thinking of this as a feasibility study, a precursor to a randomised study, then the sample should reflect the sample we expect in the trial. Ie. International, range of experiences.

Otherwise, if we are purely qualitative, we could use [information power](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1049732315617444?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed)




Things to keep in mind:

* Information power idea means that the more information a sample holds, relevant to the study, the smaller sample you need. An initial approximation of sample size is necessary for planning whilst the adequacy of the final sample size must be evaluated continuously.
* The aim of most qualitative research is not to be exhaustive, but rather to add new insights that contribute substantially to (or challenge) current understandings.
* The idea of saturation came from Grounded Theory. Saturation was when you have exhausted properties of categories and relations between them, and it requires theoretical sampling to achieve. Saturation occurs when the researcher no longer receives information that adds to the theory that has been developed.
* The meaning of saturation is less clear for other approaches. Authors don't tend to define it. Instead, they hint at "we heard it all".
