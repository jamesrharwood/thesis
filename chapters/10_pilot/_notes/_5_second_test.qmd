Notes from @UXFiveSecondRules2014

Type of "in the moment" survey method. I showed participants the top of the home page for 5 seconds before removing it again and asking questions. Exposure is limited to five seconds because although the participant can take in a lot of information within that time (colours, words, shapes), its not sufficient time to make sense of everything as a whole. The aim is to capture participant's immediate reactions to the most salient parts of the design - the colours, layout, large words, images - before they have a chance to view the page critically or with more consideration. 

As per best practice I:

* the area had very little text
* Everything was visible within one frame
* Asked few questions, ordered from most to least specific.

Was investigating 3 components:

* What are RGs 
* Benefits of RGs
* When to use RGs
* Design - simplicity and confidence
* Later, trust. Surface credibility (Fogg 2003, from chapter 4 of UX five second rule book. " That which can be perceived immediately (colors, layout, images, etc.) has the ability to boost credibility substantially—e.g.,the use of “stock photos” or public domain imagery can have a negative effect on perceived credibility, while using “real” images can help communicate a sense of authenticity and legitimacy.")
