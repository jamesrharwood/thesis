# Update in response to early, consistent feedback

Home page:

* looked simple, but this reduced trust as "anyone could have made it". 
* lacked colour
* text could be broken up by images
* "are these the guidelines journals will want?"
* Ppts not successfully recognising that the site was about writing research (as opposed to designing or plain language summaries)
* The table of commonly used guidelines was so far up that people started reading that within the first 5s, possibly removing focus from the value proposition
* The primary cta is search for guidance, the secondary is browse for guidance and was placed elsewhere. Suggestion was for both to be next to each other.

Guideline page:

* Visual incongruence with the home page. Are these the same site?
* The guidance itself was too far down. Too much front matter. All front matter looked the same - meta data, generic info about RGs, motivational stuff.
* Everyone expected the superscript notes to be references.

Changes:

Home page:

* Change the value prop to a) focus on the problem that EQUATOR solves and b) added "completeness"
* Add publishers to forster trust
* Change the font?
* Added icons to each feature and benefit
* Added a hero image to communicate 1. Biomedical research 2. checklist and 3. written report.
* Background colour that looks a bit more professional
* Quotes look more real, images make them seem legit
* Bigger emphasis on writing, so can reduce repetition of "not for designing"
* In the "what are RGs" section I've added a sentence about how research will be used by lots of different people across time. Trying to make people aware that their long-term audience is probably more diverse than they expect.

Changes to Guideline page:

* Guidance now begine much higher up. 
* Move generic "what are RGs" and "benefits" to a collapsible
* All meta data and value prop occur in a highlighted box to a) separate them from main text and b) the green links the pages
*
