There is no way I could have kept so many intervention components in my head. Using multiple methods was a nice way of covering everything without having to remember everything. 

But not everything was covered. Some components were never discussed. Maybe these were less prominent and so unnoticed? Or not discussed because not problematic? Or perhaps they are important and should not have been overlooked, so the fact they were not noticed is a problem? 

In future, I should code as I went, and then made a note to purposefully ask about components that had not come up naturally previously.



Think aloud not so useful for lots of text. Participants just read the text out loud. 

definitions. Don't use complicated words in the definitions. (WH~min 35)

OMK - very ECR (pre PhD)

OMK - No idea what RGs are. Did not understand the value proposition at all, did not think the website was trustworthy, and got nothing from the text nor image. But as she explored the home page she "got it". She eloquently explained the importance of the top of the page. Shows the difficulty in concisely communicating at the top of home page. 

OMK - at first not bothered about why items are important, but my human explanation convinced her

CW - different frame of mind storyline

Surprised by how frequently examples are mentioned. 

testimonials / quotes were polarizing. Deprioritise?

Comparison with old website - came up organically (one asked about permanence, another accidentally clicked on a link, a third remembered having used it before). OMK took 8 minutes to find SRQR E&E and said she would have given up. 

JZ - difficult to apply. Guidance is clear, but how do you start writing with it? Made me reflect on my own experience with the writing clearly book. For me, the "try this..." list at the end of each chapter was useful.

JZ (and others) - consistent terms. Ironic that I did not.

Reassurance about structure / customisability could be dotted throughout the guidance. 

Example solutions to make guidance easier to apply:

* simplest for title and abstract, because those are easy to write
* harder for e.g., intro because a lot of variation for structure
* Questions like "When did you recruit?" could be useful, especially at the beginning. 
* Examples would also be useful
* Links to general writing training could be useful
