<!-- Have I succeeded?

* Rehash why I wanted to transform RGs from a "it seemed like a good idea at the time" to a thought through intervention.
    * Main motivator was to increase efficacy and raise standard of reporting
    * But I haven't done any kind of comparison or evaluation. Could be done in future
    * Process did raise some interesting points though.
        * Norman door
        * Intention of guideline developers is for authors to consider nuanced guidance when writing. 
        * But existing distribution relied heavily on checklist enforcement by journals. Checklists lack nuance, don't link to full guidance, often much easier to find than supplementary E&Es. So guidelines were often perceived _as_ the checklists, and as an administrative task to rather than help, and as design restrictions rather than description recommendations. -->
