In addition to my results generalising, my approach could be transferable to other meta-research work. Although theories of behaviour change are used in health care and business settings, it appears less common in meta-research. I elaborate on this in (see my these Discussion #TODO) but focussing on this particular step, identifying ways to change behaviour, without a framework brainstorming may get "stuck" on certain types of intervention (in my experience, regulation, education, and training) and neglect others. Attending a workshop in early 2023, we were tasked with brainstorming ways to reduce bias in funding application assessment. One participant gave a rich account of how their team re-designed their system to minimise opportunity for bias, published case studies of how it affects applicants, how they praise examples of good practice, hold people to account when needed, and run training courses. These examples of environmental restructuring, persuasion, incentivization, and coercion were overlooked by the facilitator, who only wrote down 'training'. Familiarization with behaviour change frameworks would benefit future facilitators.
