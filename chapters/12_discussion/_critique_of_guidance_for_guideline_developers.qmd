One reason its difficult to find a path forward is because reporting guidelines have never really been characterized as an intervention. Hereby lies another irony. Guideline developers often complain that authors don't report interventions clearly (there's a whole reporting guideline - TIDIER - specifically for that). Yet if an alien nation came to Earth and wanted to disseminate reporting guidance in a similar same way, they wouldn't find a single description sufficient for replication. Sure, they would find EQUATOR's article @moherGuidanceDevelopersHealth2010 on how to _develop_ reporting guidelines, but that article doesn't describe how to disseminate guidance in much detail. For example, although it recommends to craft "each [reporting] item into a crisply and unambiguously worded checklist item", it doesn't specify what other content should be on that checklist (e.g. an introduction? Instructions on how to use it? The author list?), nor the file format (an editable Word file? A PDF?), or how the checklist should be completed (By pasting text? Entering page numbers? Ticks and crosses?). Similarly, the guidance suggests writing an accompanying Explanatory document, but doesn't specify what content should go in it. 

Another important aspect of defining interventions is describing how it is expected to work. Here, again, EQUATOR's guidance falls short. For example, it recommends guideline developers disseminate guidance by writing "a short document of about 2,000 words reporting on the rationale for developing the guidance and the development process, including a brief description of the meeting and participants involved". But why? How is knowing the guideline development process expected to influence behaviour? Why 2000 words? Our alien readers could probably guess, but they shouldn't have to. 

I'm being quite critical of EQUATOR's guidance for guideline developers. Perhaps unfairly so, as it was not intended to be an intervention definition. It is a guide, written by guideline developers with some experience under the belt, to help other prospective developers. Along the lines of _this is the best way we found to do it, so you might want to do it this way too_.
