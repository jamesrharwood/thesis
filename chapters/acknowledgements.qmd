I have been incredibly fortunate to have four supportive, knowledgeable, and encouraging supervisors. Thank you Dr Jennifer de Beyer, Dr Michael Schl√ºssel, Dr Charlotte Albury, and Professor Gary Collins for giving me the guidance, feedback, and confidence I needed. 

Thank you to my colleagues Jacqueline, Patricia, and Shona for making me feel part of the team. Thank you Caroline for welcoming me to the world of reporting guidelines, for fuelling my motivation, and for always being ready to brainstorm and put the world to rights. 

Thank you to my family and partner for always supporting me to follow my heart, head, and gut.
