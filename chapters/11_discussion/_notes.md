# PBA - Person Based Approach

### How does my approach compare with the Person Based Approach?

In practice intervention designers may use different frameworks when creating interventions.

For example, @bandInterventionPlanningDigital2017

Describe person based approach steps.

Draw parallels with the steps I took. Say what was different.

Argue why PBA was not necessary here.

PBA recommends learning from "qualitative and mixed methods evaluations of similar interventions, to understand the barriers and facilitators influencing engagement with the intervention". We could have looked at clinical practice guidelines, or others. I guess I did look at general UX stuff and instruction manual literature.

PBA step 2 is User needs studies. I could have done this but decided not to because Chapter 1 already threw up enough interesting things to get started with. And I felt that this was just "step 1" and I knew I was going to introduce feedback channels which will make that kind of user needs research easier. Because 

PBA step 3 is to develop a 'logic model/theory of change'. Apparently guidance on how to do this exists elsewhere. Not sure how I could do this with so many intervention components.

PBA step 4 could be useful. Intervention Planning Table

PBA step 5 is Guiding principles for intervention design.

Vocalise the different. The guidelines were written by some developers. 

I am interested in the way.
