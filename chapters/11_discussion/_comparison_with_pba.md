Wasn't aware of PBA when I started
There is a lot of overlap. 
Gaps: logic model? Not a part of the BCW. But I do have a theory of change because every intervention component is linked to its function and BCT. Broader logic model explaining how what I've built fits in with bigger picture would be complicated to create. A lot of variation between guidelines and between how different stakeholders use those guidelines. For example, the logic model for an endorsing journal would look different to an enfocing one. Model for PRISMA-P will look different to PRISMA. Model for funder enforcement would look different to publisher enforcement. But at the center of all of these models would be the guidelines themselves.
