| *Member-checking*                               | Lincoln and Guba argue that member checking is the most important way to the establish validity of an account @lincolnNaturalisticInquiry1985. All workshop participants could edit the worksheets during and after each workshop. At the end of each session, I would invite workshop participants to confirm that their thoughts were reflected in the file, and I invited participants to comment on my written account of the workshops.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| *Thick description*                             | Although perhaps most relevant to ethnographic studies, I nevertheless drew on relevant aspects of ‘thick description’. I encouraged participants to describe ideas in detail and to document disagreement and context. Our aim was to document ideas in sufficient detail so they could be transferable across different reporting guidelines and stakeholders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Techniques for establishing confirmability**  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| *Reflexivity*                                   | I wrote down my own ideas before each workshop, and made notes at the end of each workshop to reflect on the process. I would invite participants to consider the worksheet on their own or in pairs. I did this so that everybody would engage with the task and have an opportunity to think before being influenced by others. We then discussed ideas as a group, with members agreeing, disagreeing, and bouncing off each other. I withheld my own ideas until the end of a session or task, whereupon I would invite discussion on any ideas that I felt hadn't been covered already. This allowed me to contribute my experience from previous DPhil work, as an author, and as a software developer and give others a chance to discuss my thoughts, without biasing or narrowing discussion. |
| *Audit trail*                                   | All worksheets were stored on the University One Drive account which performs automatic saves and versioning. This created an audit trail which meant I could look at how a worksheet changed over time as participants added and edited content.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
