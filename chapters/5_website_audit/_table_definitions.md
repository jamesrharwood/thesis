| Reporting guideline database record | EQUATOR maintains a database of reporting guidelines. Each database entry is viewable as a webpage that displays the name of the guideline, bibliographic data, meta data, and links to the associated publications and files. The database page does not include the guidance itself.                                                                                   |
| Google Analytics                    | A web analytics service that tracks and reports on how many people visit a website and how they interact with it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Google Tag Manager                  | A system that allows you to "inject" code into a website to facilitate custom analytics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Google Search Console               | A service that allows website owners to check how Google's search engine indexes a website and to optimize its visibility.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| User                                | A person visiting the website (or, more specifically, a unique browser cookie).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Session                             | A single visit where one or more pages are viewed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Bounce                              | A session where a user visits a single page and performs no actions. In our setup, we considered outbound link clicks to be actions (because we want authors to click through to guidance). So if a user visited a reporting guideline database record and then immediately clicked an outbound link to a guidance publication, this would *not* be counted as a bounce. |
| Bounce Rate                         | The ratio of bounce sessions to total sessions within a given time duration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
