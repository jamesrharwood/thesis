Bounce|A session where a user visits a single page and performs no actions. In our setup, we considered outbound link clicks to be actions (because we want authors to click through to guidance). So if a user visited a reporting guideline database record and then immediately clicked an outbound link to a guidance publication, this would _not_ be counted as a bounce. 
Bounce Rate|The ratio of bounce sessions to total sessions within a given time duration.
