## An organic, complex behaviour intervention

The publishing community began to take note. The International Committee for Medical Journal Editors encouraged journals "to ask authors to follow \[reporting\] guidelines" @ICMJERecommendationsPreparing. Concerned editors sought ways to adopt reporting guidelines, and more and more journals @kochExplicitMentioningReporting2016; @sharpCrosssectionalBibliometricStudy2019 have since found a range of strategies to introduce reporting guidelines into their policies, outlined in @tbl-journal-policies. There is variation in the degree of enforcement (from passive recommendation through to compulsory enforcement) and variation in the guidelines subject to the policy; PRISMA and CONSORT and more commonly enforced than STROBE, say, and many reporting guidelines in EQUATOR's library are not enforced nor endorsed by any journals. Instead of listing reporting guidelines by name, many journals keep their instructions vague and merely recommend authors find an appropriate guideline on EQUATOR's website.

Other stakeholders have begun incorporating reporting guidelines into their policies. Conferences like the Peer Review Congress ask applicants to use reporting guidelines when writing their abstracts. MedRxiv, a large preprint server, asks authors to declare they have "followed all appropriate research reporting guidelines, such as any relevant EQUATOR Network research reporting checklist(s)" @MedRxivOrgPreprint.

EQUATOR have developed training programmes based on reporting guidelines. The training covers different ways to use reporting guidelines, including drafting manuscripts, checking manuscripts you have written, and appraising the reporting of someone else's manuscript. Researchers have developed writing software to help authors apply reporting guidelines when drafting [@barnesImpactOnlineWriting2015; @hawwashUsefulnessApplyingResearch2019], online applications to facilitate checklist and flow diagram completion [@haddawayPRISMA2020PackageShiny2022; @struthersGoodReportsDevelopingWebsite2021], and resources for reviewers to check compliance [@ComplianceQuestionnaireARRIVE].

Hence over the years, a system has organically grown around reporting guidelines, driven by separate groups of people doing what they felt was sensible. This system includes the guidance resources themselves (the publications, checklists, flow diagrams), the websites that host those resources (guideline websites, the EQUATOR website, publisher's websites), organisations that promote or enforse their use (EQUATOR, publishers, ICMJE), and staff at those institutions (researchers, editors, reviewers). These components all have the same aim: to influence what information researchers include in their articles.

As the Medical Research Council notes, a system with multiple components (like those listed above) is one of many hallmarks of a complex intervention: "an intervention might be considered complex because of properties of the intervention itself, such as the number of components involved; the range of behaviours targeted; expertise and skills required by those delivering and receiving the intervention; the number of groups, settings, or levels targeted; or the permitted level of flexibility of the intervention or its components.". The reporting guideline system exhibits these sources of complexity, as described in @tbl-complexity.

Viewing reporting guidelines as part of a complex behaviour change intervention may seem novel. Researchers often call reporting guidelines "tools" or "strategies" (#REF). In "A history of the EQUATOR Network", Doug Altman refers to reporting guidelines as "resources" that "influence" reporting, but he does not call them interventions. However, I believe my perspective is not radical. I will now outline studies exploring the efficacy of reporting guidelines, and argue that these studies take a systems perspective too although they seldom acknowledge it explicitly.
