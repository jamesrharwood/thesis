## Aims and Objectives

My aim, therefore, is to understand why reporting guidelines have not had a bigger impact on reporting quality, and to address these issues. 

My objectives are:

* To identify factors that may limit reporting guideline impact by synthesising existing research and by evaluating the EQUATOR Network website (addressed in chapters {{< var chapters.synthesis >}}-{{< var chapters.website >}})
* To work with key stakeholders to identify intervention changes to address these limiting factors (addressed in chapters {{< var chapters.bcw >}}-{{< var chapters.defining-content >}})
* To implement these changes (described in {{< var chapters.development >}})
* To refine the new intervention in response to feedback from authors (addressed in chapter {{< var chapters.pilot >}})
