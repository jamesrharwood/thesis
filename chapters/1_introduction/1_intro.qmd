In this chapter I introduce the evidence gap I have addressed and the approach I have taken to address it. I begin by describing the prevalence and consequences of poorly reported medical research. I introduce reporting guidelines and position them as part of a complex behaviour change intervention. This intervention has had a disappointing impact, as medical research is still poorly reported. This brings me to my evidence gap: how can we get more authors to adhere to reporting guidelines? I then outline my aims, objectives, and thesis structure.
