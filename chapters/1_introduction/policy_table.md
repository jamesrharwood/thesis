| Enforcing adherence                                | An editor or peer reviewer checks the article body for reporting guideline adherence and asks the author to add missing items.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Requesting peer reviewers use reporting guidelines | Editors ask peer reviewers to consider reporting guideline adherence as part of their review. Some editors may supply the reviewer with the relevant checklist.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Enforcing checklist submission                     | Editorial staff require authors to submit a completed reporting checklist as part of manuscript submission. Some journals may refuse to process a submission when the checklist is missing. Some journal submission systems may include fields for authors to upload their checklists, whereas other journals may expect authors to upload checklists as a supplementary file.                                                      |
| Journal endorsement                                | The journal's instructions to authors recommends authors follow reporting guidelines. Guidelines may be specified, in which case journals may link to guideline specific websites, to the guideline publications, or to the EQUATOR Network website. Sometimes journals include a general statement but do not name guidelines, instead referring authors to the EQUATOR website with an instruction to follow "relevant guidance". |
| Publisher endorsement                              | Sometimes reporting guideline policies are set at the level of the publisher, as is commonly done for editorial policies. Individual journals may point authors to their publisher policies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| No policy                                          | Journals have no policies regarding reporting guidelines.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

: Examples of how journals differ in how they endorse or enforce reporting guidelines into their policies. Journals also differ in which reporting guidelines their policies cover. For example, some journals may only have policies for randomised trials or systematic reviews, whereas other journals may enforce guidelines for other study types. To my knowledge, no journal explicitly advises *against* using a reporting guideline. {#tbl-journal-policies}
