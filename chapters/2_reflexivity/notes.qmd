If positionality refers to what we know and believe, then reflexivity is about what we do with this knowledge. 

Reflexivity is a form of critical thinking that prompts us to consider the ‘whys’ and ‘hows’ of research, critically questioning the utility, ethics, and value of what, whom, and how we study (Willig, 2013). 

As Lazard and McAvoy (2020, p. 177) explain, the reflexive process is ultimately based around the question “what is the research process and how am I influencing it?”. 

Crucially, reflexivity does differ from ‘reflection’, although the two have been conceptualised as existing on a continuum (Shaw, 2010). **Reflexivity refers to the conscious, active acknowledgement of one's own belief, bias, and judgement systems before, during, and after the actual research process.** In contrast, reflection is often done retrospectively and typically leads to insights about details that were ‘missed’ in the original research process. 

Reflexivity, therefore, has a greater potential to guide the research process, across all research epistemologies and methodologies.

Distinguisges between personal reflexivity, functional, and disciplinary. 

Personal is positionality
Functional is how your positionality influences choice of research questions/methods.analysis, and how the research process influences personal positionality in turn. 
Disciplinary is how the prevailing discipline paradigm and power structures limit what is considered good science. She comes from feminist psychology, so her prevailing discipline was experiemetnal psychology. Old boy's club. Firmly positivistic: values of individualism, capitalism, and male dominance were
primary. This, in turn, led to a scientific paradigm which emphasised both “objectivity”
and the “discovery” of abstract/general/universal principles of human functioning: congruent with male sex role ideals, and reaffirming (in Paul Bakan’s 1966 terms) agentic
values.
