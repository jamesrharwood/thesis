In chapter {{< var chapters.introduction >}} I gave a brief introduction to reporting guidelines. In this chapter I reflect on my own experiences with reporting guidelines, and the experience of my supervisors.

Why do I do this?

My own experience.

* Interest sparked by personal events 
* Began by thinking automation was the key, as an aid to enforcement
* Introduction to EQUATOR (what they do)
* Got to know Iveta, Caroline, and Jen when Doug worked there
* Worked with them to create wizard
* Worked with Caroline to build GoodReports
* 2018 evaluation with BMJ Open
    * Surprised that checklist submission didn't mean improved reporting
    * Realised that, for many journals, checklist enforcement was already beyond their expertise as an editor, even for a subset of checklists.

Caroline and I attributed this failure to two things: 

* GLs not being used early enough. Which we thought we could tackle with templates. Sorted. That left...
* Guideline reconciliation 

At the time, I felt like the big problem was the sheer number of requirements authors had to adhere to. Author instructions, possibly multiple reporting guidelines, funder requirements, institutional requirements. 

I interviewed adamant that I wanted to build a "requirements engine" that would be able to reconcile multiple sets of guidelines into a single, "personalised" guideline, checklist, or template.

As you'll discover, my position changed as I began to better understand authors' experiences and challenges of using guidelines. Point to discussion?
