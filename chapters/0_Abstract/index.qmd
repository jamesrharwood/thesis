The lasting legacy of most medical research is the written account. Authors often miss out information needed by readers &mdash; including clinicians, reviewers, patients, and other researchers &mdash; need to fully understand, appraise, replicate, or apply the research. Reporting guidelines try to solve this problem. They are community-created recommendations for information to include in a research article so that everybody can use it. The first reporting guideline was created almost 30 years ago, and many more have been created since. Most leading medical journals ask authors to adhere to reporting guidelines, yet adherence remains low in almost all medical fields. When authors do not adhere to reporting guidelines their work is less transparent, less valuable, contributes less to patient outcomes and has potential to inadvertently harm by distorting the evidence base. The aim of my thesis is to understand why authors do not adhere to reporting guidelines when writing up medical research, and to address these reasons with the intention of increasing adherence in the future. 

Methods

My mixed-methods approach explored barriers and solutions to reporting guideline adherence. I explored barriers through a qualitative evidence synthesis, a review of survey content, and a website evaluation. I used a framework for creating behaviour change interventions &mdash; the Behaviour Change Wheel &mdash; to understand these barriers and to explore potential solutions in workshops with reporting guideline experts, and in focus groups with researchers, publishers, and guideline developers. I combined the results to define intervention components using behaviour change techniques to address identified barriers. I implemented these components by redesigning a reporting guideline (Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research; SRQR). I used interviews, observation, think-aloud, and writing appraisals to collect feedback from 11 authors, and then made refinements.
