# Abstract: 

## Background

Medical research remains poorly reported despite many journals
recommending reporting guidelines. Understanding the experiences of
authors may reveal barriers that currently limit guideline impact.
Whilst conducting a thematic synthesis of authors' experiences of using
reporting guidelines (see part one, \[insert DOI\]) we found many
studies that asked quantitative questions. The questions asked are
important because they may reveal possible facilitators and barriers
that the survey writers have considered and may also bias responses to
subsequent qualitative questions. We describe the quantitative questions
asked in those surveys and how the questions relate to themes identified
in our thematic synthesis of qualitative data.

## Main Body

Our systematic search retrieved 22 studies that collected quantitative
survey data on researcher's opinions of 25 reporting guidelines. Survey
participants most often came from USA, Europe, and Canada. Quantitative
questions frequently asked about awareness, usage, usability,
usefulness, importance, barriers, facilitators, content, and whether
reporting guidelines had led to a change in behaviour. Most ideas also
appeared in the qualitative data with the following exceptions: language
barriers, awareness of the EQUATOR Network, enforcement by funders and
employers, and transparency and evidence in guideline development.
However, many facilitators and barriers mentioned in qualitative data
were absent from quantitative questions, and qualitative data often
provided explanation or context for quantitative findings.

## Conclusion

Although a few facilitators and barriers appeared exclusively in the
quantitative questions, qualitative questions resulted in richer data
with many ideas otherwise absent from quantitative questions. Surveys
were subject to recruitment, recall, and question bias and quantitative
data may benefit from qualitative contextualisation. Few reporting
guidelines have undergone either qualitative or quantitative user
testing. Future research should consider collecting qualitative data and
aim to recruit participants that reflect their expected user base.

# Background 

The EQUATOR Network (1) indexes hundreds of reporting guidelines to help
biomedical researchers report their work completely and transparently.
Reporting guidelines provide recommendations for authors on the minimum
information that readers need to fully understand, appraise, synthesise,
and in principle replicate a study. Adherence to reporting guidelines,
however, remains low, (2) perhaps because authors face barriers when
using them.

In a companion paper (in press), we identified potential facilitators
and barriers in a thematic synthesis of research articles that collected
qualitative data on researchers' experiences of using reporting
guidelines. During our search, we observed that many studies also
included quantitative survey questions, and despite not considering them
in the qualitative synthesis, we felt that these questions were
important to investigate for two reasons. Firstly, as many of the
researchers designing these surveys were themselves users or developers
of reporting guidelines the questions may reflect real barriers or
facilitators that they have experienced, witnessed, or are trying to
avoid or achieve. Secondly, in mixed-method surveys, quantitative
questions may bias responses to subsequent qualitative questions and,
therefore, the findings of our thematic synthesis. For instance,
qualitative questions like "Anything else?" or "Please elaborate" may
lead respondents to neglect or repeat topics covered by the previous
quantitative questions.

In this study, we describe the landscape and content of quantitative
surveys that solicit information on author experience of using reporting
guidelines. Our aim was to identify additional possible barriers and
facilitators that were absent from the qualitative evidence synthesis.

# Main text

## Methods

Our qualitative synthesis included a systematic search that sought to
capture all survey studies investigating reporting guidelines (see (in
press) for full search details). We found 22 studies that included
quantitative survey questions, 14 of which also included one or more
qualitative questions (see Table 1). YD translated two studies from
Chinese into English(4,5). One author (JH) imported files into NVivo,
including the full surveys where available, labelled all questions with
descriptive codes, creating new codes when necessary, and then
inductively grouped related codes into broad categories (see Table 2).

## Results

### What reporting guidelines were studied?

Between the 22 studies 25 reporting guidelines were mentioned, most
frequently PRISMA (n=6), STARD (n=6), CONSORT (n=6) and ARRIVE (n=5).
Thus, only a small proportion of the reporting guidelines indexed in
EQUATOR's database (1) have been evaluated with quantitative questions.
Fourteen studies focussed on a single guideline (n=14), with others
asking questions about multiple guidelines (e.g. "which reporting
guidelines \[participants\] had known"(6)) or guidelines in general
(e.g., "whether they had used reporting guidelines in their
publications"(7)). Most studies included participants from the USA,
Europe, and Canada and only a few studies conducted elsewhere (e.g.,
China and Turkey) (see Table 1).

In comparison, our thematic synthesis (in press) identified 18 studies
that collected qualitative data. These studies covered only 12 reporting
guidelines and were all conducted in western countries, hence were
slightly less diverse than the quantitative survey studies.

### The focus of quantitative questions

Survey studies asked participants:

-   whether they were aware or familiar with certain reporting
    guidelines,

-   how often they used them and what for,

-   whether reporting guidelines had influenced their behaviour,

-   whether guidance was usable and useful,

-   their opinions on guidance content,

-   their reasons for using a reporting guideline,

-   their opinions on reporting quality in the literature,

-   whether reporting guidelines were easy to find and access,

-   whose role it was to check for compliance,

-   whether the aim of the guidance was clear, and

-   opinions on things explicitly named as a barrier including the
    length of the guidance, the language it is written in, and the time
    needed to use it.

-   opinions on things explicitly named as a facilitator or motivator
    including endorsements, evidence, explanatory information, training,
    the behaviour of peers, and the development process of the guidance.

### Comparing the focus of quantitative questions with themes derived from qualitative data

The quantitative questions included some novel barriers and facilitators
not contained in the qualitative data (shown in bold in Table 2), such
as training as a possible facilitator (8), whether authors had heard of
the EQUATOR Network (6,8), and whether transparency in guideline
development is important (8). One study asked whether language may be a
barrier to using reporting guidelines for some(9). This concern may have
been missing from the qualitative studies because they were conducted in
English. Both quantitative questions and the qualitative data mentioned
journals enforcing reporting guidelines, but only quantitative questions
asked whether funders and employers should also enforce them.

Most ideas captured in the quantitative questions also appeared in the
qualitative data. This may indicate that the quantitative questions
asked were pertinent, or perhaps that they influenced participants'
responses to subsequent, qualitative questions, as mixed method surveys
were included in this commentary and the qualitative synthesis.

Overall, we found that the qualitative data contained many ideas that
were not addressed by the quantitative questions (see bold items in
Table 3). These included what authors understand reporting guidelines to
be, the pros and cons of itemization, ideas of how guidance could be
improved, negative feelings when an item cannot be reported as desired,
the pros and cons of including design advice in reporting guidance,
whether optional items were understood as being optional, and
frustration when the scope of a reporting guideline is too broad,
narrow, or unclear.

Qualitative data sometimes provided context to or explanation for
quantitative answers (see italicised items in Table 3). For example,
many of the quantitative surveys asked participants whether they could
understand the guidance. However, a quantitative answer to this question
does not reveal *what* the participant understands, *how* they
understand it, or whether they understand it *as intended*. The
qualitative data contained reports of people failing to understand the
wording of an item, how to report that item in practice, whether an item
applies to them, whether a reporting guideline applies to them, what the
intended scope of a reporting guideline is, or even what a reporting
guideline is at all. One study found that although authors reported
understanding an item, their writing showed that they had interpreted it
differently to how the reporting guideline developers had intended(10).

## Advice for future studies

As very few reporting guidelines have undergone any kind of user
testing, we urge guideline developers to evaluate their resources to
ensure researchers understand their content, aim, and applicability
criteria. Advice on how to go about this could be included in an update
of guidance for guideline developers, the current version of which
contains little advice on how to evaluate reporting guidelines(3).

Because quantitative surveys can miss or mask important findings,
developers seeking actionable feedback should collect qualitative data
when assessing how researchers understand or feel about reporting
guidelines, or what could be done to improve the guidance. As survey
studies are subject to recall bias when participants are describing past
behaviour or opinions, future studies could consider methods that allow
researchers to document experiences in real time, like observation or
think aloud tasks.

Studies should ensure participants represent expected users in terms of
academic writing experience, discipline, profession, experience (or
naivety) with reporting guidelines, and language -- or even focus on
differential experiences of specific target groups. For example, the
EQUATOR Network website gets similar levels of traffic from Asia and
Europe, yet very little research into usability or barriers of reporting
guidelines has included authors from Asian countries (11). The website
also sees many new visitors who abandon the site quickly, without
accessing any reporting guidance. These visitors may be authors who are
naïve to reporting guidelines and decide not to use one. Most of the
included studies used snowball sampling or required authors to read the
guidance as part of the study itself, and so don't capture perspectives
of these less-engaged authors.

We recommend surveys avoid leading questions. For example, the Likert
rated statements "The STARD 2015 guidelines are easy to follow" (9) and
"The time required to adhere to the STARD 2015 guidelines is a barrier
to using the guidelines" (9) are both subject to acquiescence bias --
the tendency for participants to agree with research statements (12).
Future studies should consider using neutral questions, such as "Do you
think the STARD 2015 guidelines are easy to follow?".

Studies used lots of different words to describe reporting guidelines,
including *guidelines, standards, requirements, checklist, example and
elaboration,* or just an acronym, e.g., CONSORT. This became a problem
in studies where participants were not supplied with guidance, as it was
not always clear which document a participant was considering. For
instance, asking participants whether PRISMA is easy to understand will
not tell you whether they are talking about the PRISMA checklist,
statement, or explanation and elaboration document. Future studies
should be specific when asking questions and reporting results.

## Conclusion

Very few reporting guidelines have been evaluated using either
quantitative or qualitative methods. Quantitative surveys often asked
about awareness, usage, usability, usefulness, importance, barriers,
facilitators, content, and whether reporting guidelines had led to a
change in behaviour but did not address many other themes identified in
our qualitative synthesis. Reporting guideline developers who want to
make sure their resources are easy to use should consider using
qualitative methods, which may produce richer, actionable insights.

## Competing interests

As thematic synthesis involves subjective interpretation, we reflected
on the opinions, beliefs, and experiences of the authors as potential
sources of conflicts of interest.

All authors except CA are affiliated with the EQUATOR Network, which
promotes reporting guidelines. All authors consider incomplete research
reporting to be a common and important problem and believe reporting
guidelines and checklists to be useful tools. GSC is Director of the UK
EQUATOR Centre and an author of the TRIPOD guidelines for clinical
prediction models, GATHER statement for global health estimates,
TIDieR-placebo for placebo-controlled trials, RIPL checklist for patent
landscapes, and member of the MISTIC, STARD-AI, TRIPOD-AI, DECIDE-AI,
CONSORT-AI and SPIRIT-AI working groups, and SK is an author of the
PRISMA-S guidelines for reporting systematic review literature searches.
ZB is Director of the Chinese EQUATOR Centre. ZB and YD have helped
develop reporting guidelines for Chinese medicine and have translated
existing guidelines into Chinese, including nine CONSORT extensions, the
ARRIVE guidelines, and the SPIRIT extension for patient-reported
outcomes. MMS is leading studies that assess reporting completeness in
health research based on the contents of several reporting guidelines
checklists, the robustness of reporting guidelines development methods,
and the consolidation of different reporting guidelines for the
reporting of studies of nutritional interventions. JH is the creator of
an automated manuscript checker(13) that recommends guidelines to
authors, but had not used a reporting guideline before writing this
article. His experience in software development led him to question the
usability of reporting guidelines and the ways in which authors discover
and apply them.
