## Table: Lincoln and Guba's Evaluative Criteria
See: http://www.qualres.org/HomeLinc-3684.html

### Techniques for establishing credibility

Done: 

* Member-checking

" Definition

This is when data, analytic categories, interpretations and conclusions are tested with members of those groups from whom the data were originally obtained.

This can be done both formally and informally as opportunities for member checks may arise during the normal course of observation and conversation.

Typically, member checking is viewed as a technique for establishing to the validity of an account. 

Lincoln and Guba posit that this is the most crucial technique for establishing credibility.  However, this technique is controversial.

"

* Peer debriefing

Definition

"It is a process of exposing oneself to a disinterested peer in a manner paralleling an analytical sessions and for the purpose of exploring aspects of the inquiry that might otherwise remain only implicit within the inquirer's mind" (Lincoln & Guba, 1985, p. 308)

Purpose of debriefing

through analytical probing a debriefer can help uncover taken for granted biases, perspectives and assumptions on the researcher's part
through this process the researcher can become aware of his/her posture toward data and analysis
this is an opportunity to test and defend emergent hypotheses and see if they seem reasonable and plausible to a disinterested debriefer
provide the researcher with an opportunity for catharsis

Not done: 

* Prolonged Engagement
* Persistent Observation
* Triangulation
* Peer debriefing
* Negative case analysis
* Referential adequacy

Techniques for establishing transferability

* "Thick descripton refers to the detailed account of field experiences in which the researcher makes explicit the patterns of cultural and social relationships and puts them in context (Holloway, 1997)." - NB I should add context to quotes, e.g. who said it. 

This can be contrasted with thin description, which is a superficial account." 

Techniques for establishing dependability

* Inquiry audit. Could do #ASK. "External audits involve having a researcher not involved in the research process examine both the process and product of the research study.  The purpose is to evaluate the accuracy and evaluate whether or not the findings, interpretations and conclusions are supported by the data."

Techniques for establishing confirmability

* audit trail "An audit trail is a transparent description of the research steps taken from the start of a research project to the development and reporting of findings.  These are records that are kept regarding what was done in an investigation." Categories include: 
    * "Raw data - including all raw data, written field notes, unobstrusive measures (documents)
    * Data reduction and analysis products - including summaries such as condensed notes, unitized informaiton and quantitative summaries and theoretical notes
    * Data reconstruction and synthesis products - including structure of categories (themes, definitions, and relationships), findings and conclusions and a final report including connections to existing literatures and an integration of concepts, relationships, and interpretations
    * Process notes - including methodological notes (procedures, designs, strategies, rationales), trustworthiness notes (relating to credibility, dependability and confirmability) and audit trail notes
    * Materials relating to intentions and dispositions - including inquiry proposal, personal notes (reflexive notes and motivations) and expectations (predictions and intentions)
    * Instrument development information - including pilot forms, preliminary schedules, observation formats
* Reflexivity: "Reflexivity is an attitude of attending systematically to the context of knowledge construction, especially to the effect of the researcher, at every step of the research process. 

"A researcher's background and position will affect what they choose to investigate, the angle of investigation, the methods judged most adequate for this purpose, the findings considered most appropriate, and the framing and communication of conclusions" (Malterud, 2001, p. 483-484).

The perspective or position of the researcher shapes all research - quantitative, qualitative, even laboratory science."

Not done: 
* triangulation - not done. 
* Confirmability audit (basically same as inquiry audit)
