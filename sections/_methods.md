Qualitative approach and research paradigm: Qualitative approach (e.g., ethnography, grounded theory, case study, phenomenology, narrative research) and guiding theory if appropriate; identifying the research paradigm (e.g., post-positivist, constructivist/interpretivist) is also recommended; rationale."}
Our qualitative approach was active research, whereby participants and researchers generated ideas linked to theoretical concepts from the Behaviour Change Wheel (#REF). Our paradigm was post-positivist; we considered that ideas were "out there" and recognised that the opinions of the lead researchers may influence what they observe and conclude, and attempted to mitigate against this (see _Techniques to Enhance Trustworthiness_ <!--#TODO: add link-->). <!-- # ASK: Active research post-positivist? -->

Reflecting on our prior held opinions, all authors believed reporting to be important. With the exception of CA, all authors have a history of developing or advocating for reporting guidelines. JH, JdB and MS fed their ideas into the focus groups. GC had professional relationships with some of the invited guideline developers but was not involved in the focus groups which were facilitated by JH, a PhD student with no prior relationships. JH has a background in software development and user experience and as a novice researcher has experienced first hand frustration when trying to use reporting guidelines, and so came to this study with a slightly different perspective. As a relative outsider to the reporting guideline ecosystem, he hoped that participants would feel comfortable to speak candidly and non-defensively about the strengths and weaknesses of reporting guidelines. JH maintained reflexivity by reflecting on prior-held beliefs and maintaining a journal.

We ran focus groups over Microsoft Teams, with participants attending from their usual place of work of home.
