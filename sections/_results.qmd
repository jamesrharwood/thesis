# Results

## Units of study 

#TODO participants attended one of {{< var focus_groups_count >}} focus groups. Participants included guideline developers (n=#TODO), publishing professionals (n=#TODO), and academics that study reporting guidelines (n=#TODO). 

Participants identified {{< var counts.sub_items_pre_jh >}} ideas to address {{< var counts.barriers >}} barriers. JH added a further {{< var counts.jh_ideas >}} ideas to this list retrospectively to make {{< var counts.sub_items >}} ideas in total. JH then grouped these ideas into {{< var counts.changes >}} broader ideas, which we categorised according to whether they could be considered {{< var descriptions.stages >}}. Participants identified {{< counts.stakeholders >}} stakeholders that could enact these ideas including {{< descriptions.stakeholders >}}.

<!-- #TODO: Compare with the number of ideas, barriers and stakeholders identified by EQUATOR before the focus groups began. -->

_Synthesis and interpretation:_

<!-- #TODO: For each idea write a small discussion of the focus group data, e.g., highlighting disagreements and 'popular' barriers. -->

<!-- Main findings (e.g., interpretations, inferences, and
themes); might include development of a theory or model, or integration with
prior research or theory -->

<!-- Links to empirical data - Evidence (e.g., quotes, field notes, text excerpts,
photographs) to substantiate analytic findings -->
