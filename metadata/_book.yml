  #     Here is the working version of my thesis. 

  #     :::{.content-visible when-format="html"}
  #     You'll find chapters on the left, and can download Word files for each chapter on the right. 

  #     Chapters that I've not done (including this one) are [this colour]{.text-muted}. Chapters in [this colour]{.text-warning} are a works-in-progress. 
  #     :::

  #     If you see anything like "\@something", "**?:something**", or "#TODO" then please ignore. 

  #     Some of the tables and figures aren't rendering nicely yet, especially in Word format. You can ignore that too. 

  #     :::{.content-visible when-format="docx"}
  #     Known todos for DOCX output:

  #     * Title page 
  #     * Appendices should come after references
  #     * Table and figure formatting
  #     * Add "Reflections on this chapter" paragraphs to end of research chapters
  #     * Need to write: Abstract, Interviews chapter, Discussion
  #     * Lists of tables & figures at start (necessary?)

  #     ## Word Count Tallies: 

  #     Actual word counts will be lower as these numbers include tables and references for each chapter.
