# Item 1. Title: Concise description of the nature and topic of the study. Identifying the study as qualitative or indicating the approach (e.g., ethnography, grounded theory) or data collection methods (e.g., interview, focus group) is recommended.

problem-formulation: |+
  Here is something,\n\n

  and something else on a new line\n\n
  
  * what is known about the probleM

    * We know that reporting is substandard
    * We know that RGs have had limited effect
    * We now know lots of reasons _why_ RGs effect may be limited.
      * Evidence comes from thematic synthesis, commentary and website review.
      * Summarize some of the main themes
  * gaps in current knowledge (problem statement)
    * We _don't_ know how to address these problems.
  * review theoretical/empirical work directly relevant to problem/phenomena
    * We view RGs as a complex behaviour change intervention where RGs are part of a system.
    * The BCW is a method for designing complex interventions.
    * We chose it because it is thorough (made by synthesising other methods), based on a model of behaviour (the COM-B model) and because it is accessible to non-behavioural experts.
  * why qualitative? (To generate ideas)
# ASK: Charlotte is this necessary?

purpose-of-research-question: |
  The purpose of this study was to elicit possible solutions to barriers currently limiting RG impact from experts familiar with RG dissemination.

# Methods
# Item 5. Qualitative approach and research paradigm: Qualitative approach (e.g., ethnography, grounded theory, case study, phenomenology, narrative research) and guiding theory if appropriate; identifying the research paradigm (e.g., post-positivist, constructivist/interpretivist) is also recommended; rationale.
qualitative-approach-and-research-paradigm: |
  Our qualitative approach was active research, whereby participants and researchers generated ideas linked to theoretical concepts from the Behaviour Change Wheel (#REF).
  Our paradigm was post-positivist; we considered that ideas were "out there" and recognised that the opinions of the lead researchers may influence what they observe and conclude, and attempted to mitigate against this (see _Techniques to Enhance Trustworthiness_).
# ASK: Active research post-positivist?

researcher-characteristics-and-reflexivity: |
  All authors have a history of developing or advocating for reporting guidelines, with the exception of CA. JH, JdB and MS fed their ideas into the focus groups. GC had professional relationships with some of the invited guideline developers but was not involved in the focus groups which were all facilitated by JH, a PhD student with no prior relationships. JH has a background in software development and user experience, and so came to this study with a slightly different perspective. As a relative outsider to the reporting guideline ecosystem, he hoped that participants would feel comfortable to speak candidly and non-defensively about the strengths and weaknesses of reporting guidelines. JH maintained reflexivity by reflecting on prior-held beliefs and maintaining a journal.  
# All agreed that RGs were not perfect
# All agreed that reporting is important # ASK: Charlotte's prior held beliefs? 

context: |
  We ran focus groups over Microsoft Teams, with participants attending from their usual place of work of home.
