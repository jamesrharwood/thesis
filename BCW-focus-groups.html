<li>We view RGs as a complex behaviour change intervention where RGs are part of a system.</li>
<li>The BCW is a method for designing complex interventions.</li>
<li>We chose it because it is thorough (made by synthesising other methods), based on a model of behaviour (the COM-B model) and because it is accessible to non-behavioural experts.</li>

<p>The purpose of this study was to elicit possible solutions to barriers currently limiting RG impact from experts familiar with RG dissemination.</p>

<h1>Methods</h1>
<div class="SRQR" data="Item 5. Qualitative approach and research paradigm: Qualitative approach (e.g., ethnography, grounded theory, case study, phenomenology, narrative research) and guiding theory if appropriate; identifying the research paradigm (e.g., post-positivist, constructivist/interpretivist) is also recommended; rationale.">
<p>Our qualitative approach was active research, whereby participants and researchers generated ideas linked to theoretical concepts from the Behaviour Change Wheel (#REF). Our paradigm was post-positivist; we considered that ideas were “out there” and recognised that the opinions of the lead researchers may influence what they observe and conclude, and attempted to mitigate against this (see <em>Techniques to Enhance Trustworthiness</em> <!--#TODO: add link-->). <!-- # ASK: Active research post-positivist? --></p>
</div>
<p>::: {.SRQR data=” Researcher characteristics and reflexivity: Researchers’ characteristics that may influence the research, including personal attributes, qualifications/experience, relationship with participants, assumptions, and/or presuppositions; potential or actual interaction between researchers’ characteristics and the research questions, approach, methods, results and/or transferability.” } Reflecting on our prior held opinions, all authors believed reporting to be important. With the exception of CA, all authors have a history of developing or advocating for reporting guidelines. JH, JdB and MS fed their ideas into the focus groups. GC had professional relationships with some of the invited guideline developers but was not involved in the focus groups which were facilitated by JH, a PhD student with no prior relationships. JH has a background in software development and user experience and as a novice researcher has experienced first hand frustration when trying to use reporting guidelines, and so came to this study with a slightly different perspective. As a relative outsider to the reporting guideline ecosystem, he hoped that participants would feel comfortable to speak candidly and non-defensively about the strengths and weaknesses of reporting guidelines. JH maintained reflexivity by reflecting on prior-held beliefs and maintaining a journal.<br>

Consider making guidance modular, like the Journal Article Reporting Standards for psychology.</p>
<p>Prospective guideline developers should consult EQUATOR’s register of guidelines under development and contact the developers of related guidelines before commencing.</p>

<!-- #ASK Olga: is this negative education? -->
<p>Reporting guidance could encourage transparent reporting irregardless of design choices.

<p>Authors may benefit from guideline specific education or training. Students could learn the importance of good reporting, and good workflows for documenting and communication research, and how to think about writing as a process. Students could attempt a replication or be asked to use a RG as part of their studies. These could be delivered on or offline, as education or training.</p>
