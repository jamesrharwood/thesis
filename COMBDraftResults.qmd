## Hello COM-Bers!

Thank you for taking the time to read this ðŸ¤©

I asked guideline experts to to expand upon the output of our previous meetings. I've rearranged the results into a list of possible changes and the barriers they address.

If you have time before we meet:

* Please read through the possible changes. Feel free to add comments. You can read through the barriers too if you want a refresher.
* As you read, see if you agree with the stakeholders I've listed for each change.
* If you have time and motivation, try wireframing what a guideline page could look like, and what the home page could look like. But no pressure - I've spent time doing this already so we will already have plenty to talk about!

Thank you!
