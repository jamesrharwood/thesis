---

id: what-rgs-exist
title: What reporting guidelines exist?
driver_id: capability
---

* Researchers may not be aware of which reporting guidelines exist
* Researchers may not know how to search for reporting guidelines or what to search for
* Most guidelines on the EQUATOR site are hardly ever accessed

---

id: scope
title: When does guidance apply?
driver_id: capability
---

* If the scope is undefined researchers won’t know whether the guidance applies to them
* Researchers may not understand study designs, making it difficult for them to identify which guidance applies

---

id: best-fit
title: Which guideline fits best?
driver_id: capability
relation_ids: [what-rgs-exist, scope]
---

* Researchers may not know what guidance exists
* Researchers may not realise that more specific guidance exists
* An author’s “perfect fit” guideline may not exist
* "Perfect fit" will change over time as new guidelines become available
* ≠Researchers may not understand whether a guideline includes optional items, or whether a particular item applies to them

---

id: what-resources-exist
title: What resources exist for each guideline?
driver_id: capability
---

* Resources include the guidance itself, checklists, e&e files, templates, web tools (e.g. PRISMA flow chart maker), e.t.c.,
* Researchers might not know which tools or resources exist for a particular guideline
* Researchers may predominantly use the checklist and might rarely (or never) consult the full E&E
  * Researchers may encounter the checklists but never discover or read the explanation & elaboration document
  * Researchers may never discover examples if they are separate to the main guidance or checklist
* Many researchers will only ever use the checklist. Sometimes this is purposeful, but other times it may be because researchers don’t know that an E&E exists.
* Some will read the E&E fully, but many will dip in and out whilst using the checklist

---

id: when-to-use
title: When should reporting guidelines be used?
driver_id: capability
---

* Many authors discover guidelines because they are asked to submit a checklist.
* Many may only ever experience guidelines as checklists.
* Guideline developers may want authors to use guidance as early as possible, but this is not obvious to authors who may think that guidelines are supposed to be used as pre-submission checklists to demonstrate adherence.

---

id: understanding
title: (Mis)understanding
driver_id: capability
---

* Researchers may not understand the guidance as developers intended, or at all
* Researchers may not understand concepts, terms or words within the guidance, or they may understand them differently to how the developers intended
* Researchers may have nowhere to turn for help should they not understand something
* Some items (or entire guidelines) might be new concepts
* E.g. SQUIRE guidelines written at a time where Quality Improvement was still a new concept to many people
* Some items within SQUIRE (e.g. Context, Study of the intervention) are less familiar than others.

id: benefits
title: What benefits to expect
driver_id: capability
relation_ids: [believed-benefits]
---

* Researchers may not know what benefits to expect from using a reporting guideline
* Researchers report caring more about personal, immediate benefits compared to hypothetical benefits to others
* Researchers report wanting to feel confident, be better at their job and do their job more quickly. Researchers may not expect reporting guidelines to help them achieve these personal goals
* In addition to improving completeness of reporting, guidelines can also improve flow and potentially eliminate “waffle”
* Guidelines can help structure discussions between collaborators, especially at the design or protocol stage
* Researchers may not understand that using a reporting guideline will help them publish and make the process (or publishing and peer review) more efficient & less hassle(y).
* Researchers may not understand how transparent reporting helps research consumers use your research, or why poor reporting leads to waste
* Following a guideline can help consumers find information more easily
* Even if researchers do understand about research waste they may not care

Researchers may not know why an item is important, or who it is important to.

---

id: how-to-do
title: Researchers may not know how to do an item
driver_id: capability
---

If an author doesn’t know how to do something (e.g., a sample size calculation) then they cannot report it

---

id: how-to-report

Researchers may not understand how to report a particular item in practice

---

id: how-to-report-not-done
title: Researchers may not know how to report an item that they did not, or could not, do
driver_id: capability
---

* Researchers may not know how to report something that they didn’t (or couldn’t) do
* This is more likely to happen if author encounters guidance late
* If an author doesn’t know how to do something (e.g., a sample size calculation) then they cannot report it
* Researchers may not be able to report an item because of external reasons (e.g., IP, or data was missing from primary studies)

---

id: need-enough-time
title: Researchers have limited time
driver_id: opportunity
---

* Using a reporting guideline takes time and work
* Guidelines and checklists take time to find, read and understand
* Researchers & developers may underestimate the time required for writing
* Guideline items may requires input from multiple people.
* Researchers want to know which items to prioritize
* Completing checklists with page numbers is annoying if you then edit the manuscript and creates work for editors/reviewers
* Many reporting checklists simply ask researchers to indicate the page where relevant info is reported in the manuscript. Such page numbers likely change between versions of the manuscript (e.g. after revisions), meaning they need to be repeatedly updated.
* Recording the page number only puts the onus on peer reviewers and editors to search through the page to find the relevant info

* Guidelines and checklists require work to apply. Sometimes this work requires input from multiple people.

---

id: need-translations
title: Researchers may need guidance in a language they can understand
driver_id: opportunity
relation_ids: [understanding]
---

* Researchers may not understand the language guidance is written in
* A lot of research comes from countries where English is not the first language.
* A lot of EQUATOR visitors too
* Even if author speaks English, language may be an additional barrier especially if motivation is low

---

id: need-concise-writing
title: Researchers may need to keep writing concise
driver_id: opportunity
---

* Following a guideline can result in lengthy, bloated reports
* Researchers may not know how to keep writing fluid and concise without letting the manuscript bloat
* Researchers may be constrained by journal word limits
* Researchers may not know where they can report an item, e.g., what section, in the text or in a table or figure, in the manuscript or in supplementary material

---

id: need-tools
title: Researchers may need tools for the job at hand
driver_id: opportunity
---

* Researchers use reporting guidelines for different tasks and want tools to make that job easier.
* Researchers may not know when they are supposed to use a reporting guideline, or for what task
* Researchers report using reporting guidelines for:
  * Planning research
  * Designing research
    * Researchers want items presented in the order in which decisions need to be made
    * Researchers want links to resources
  * Whilst collecting data
    * Researchers want items ordered in the order they are done
    * Items embedded into data collection tools
* Drafting manuscript
  * templates
* Checking manuscripts
* Demonstrating compliance
  * Checklists embedded into submission workflows
* Reviewing the reporting of other people’s manuscripts

* Compared to other guidance or compared to current research standards

---

id: need-to-reconcile
title: Researchers may need to reconcile multiple sets of guidance
driver_id: opportunity
---

* Researchers may have to reconcile multiple sets of guidelines
* Researchers must adhere to journal guidelines, multiple reporting guidelines (e.g., PRISMA + PRISMA-Abstracts + PRISMA-S) and other best practice guidelines (like NIH principles)
* Guidelines can contradict each other e.g., journal guidelines vs reporting guidelines on abstract structure
* Using multiple guidelines increases complexity and costs

---

id: need-to-remove
title: Researchers may be asked to remove guideline content
driver_id: opportunity
---

* Researchers may be asked to remove guideline content by co-researchers, editors or reviewers

---

id: need-prompts
title: Researchers may need prompting to use guidelines at earlier research stages
driver_id: opportunity
relation_ids: [need-enough-time, need-right-time]
---

* Researchers may encounter guidelines late in their writing process
* They then may continue to only ever use guidance late
* The balance of costs vs benefits is at its worst when reporting guidelines are used late. Researchers may be reluctant to change their work once they are ready to submit. They lack time and motivation, and it may be awkward for them to send a draft back to their co-researchers.
* Some researchers report wanting to be told to use reporting guidelines earlier in their research pipeline

---

id: need-findable
title: Easy to Find
driver_id: opportunity
relation_ids: [what-rgs-exist]
---

* Once an author knows that a guideline exists (e.g. they have heard its name or description) they should be able to find the guidance and associated resources easily.
* Researchers may not know how to search for reporting guidelines, what terms to search with, or where to find resources for a particular guideline that they know to exist.
* Researchers may not be able to navigate the EQUATOR Network website
* Guidance can be buried within a longer development article

---

id: need-accessible
title: (In)accessible resources
driver_id: opportunity
---

<!-- #TODO: Need Accessible -->
* Open access
* Researchers may struggle to access guidance after discovering that it exists.

id: feel-transparent
title: Researchers may feel afraid to report transparently
driver_id: motivation
relation_ids: [how-to-report-not-done]
---

* Researchers may not know how to report something that they didn’t (or couldn’t) do, which may leave them feeling uncertain or afraid to be transparent
* This is more likely to happen if author encounters guidance late

---

id: feel-restricted
title: Researchers may feel restricted if reporting guidelines prescribe design
driver_id: motivation
---

* Assumptions about the design choices narrow the scope of the guidance and can make checklists appear restrictive
* Sometimes design advice can be implicit. PRISMA 20* says “report what method you used to assess risk of bias”, it’s implying that they should have designed their review to assess risk of bias.

---

id: feel-not-my-job
title: Researchers may feel that checking reporting is someone else's job.
driver_id: motivation
---

* Researchers may feel that demonstrating or checking for guideline (or checklist) compliance is the responsibility of the editor or reviewer.
* Editors and reviewers may also disagree about whose role it is
* It would be nice if authors, editors and reviewers all checked for reporting quality, but this research focusses on authors.
* Researchers report feeling that completing a reporting checklist should be the job of the editor or peer reviewer, not the author

---

id: feel-not-a-job
title: Researchers may not consider reporting to be a stage of work
driver_id: motivation
---

* Researchers may need to change their work practices to use reporting guidance
* Researchers may not know how to fit reporting guidelines into their writing process (e.g., structuring / drafting / editing), or may not have a writing process at all
* Researchers may not know how to write / communicate clearly
* Researchers may not have access to help from within their institution (e.g., a publications coordinator or research integrity training)
* Researchers may not know how a team can use reporting guidelines in practice
* Researchers may be stuck in their ways, not be open to new ways of working
* Researchers may never develop a habit of using guidance, or of searching for guidance as the first step of writing
