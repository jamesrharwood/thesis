Summarize what RGs are, how and when to use them, what personal benefits to expect, and the importance to others. A generalised statement could go wherever authors are likely to first encounter RGs e.g., journal author guidelines, EQUATOR's home page. A guideline specific statement could go at the top of guideline resources.

Ensure all resources are in ready-to-use formats (e.g. Word files) as opposed to e.g., checklists as tables within published articles that have to be copied by the user.

Ensure all resources are open access. This allows access to authors without journal subscriptions and allows others to build upon the guidance.

Avoid prescribing structure as it may clash with journal guidelines or other reporting guidelines. Instead, give options for where items can be reported including options beyond the article body (e.g. tables, figures, appendices).

stage: planning
---

 To avoid duplicating resources, developers could consult EQUATOR's register of guidelines under development and contact the developers of related guidelines before commencing a new guideline. When a new resource is justified, developers could build on top of existing resources instead of starting from scratch. This could mean extending or replacing subsets of items instead of publishing a totally new guideline. Developers could consider making guidance modular, like the Journal Article Reporting Standards for psychology. This could also be done retrospectively, e.g., by splitting broad guidance into shorter, related resources (e.g. STROBE being split into STROBE Cohort, STROBE Case-control and STROBE Cross-section).

Stakeholders could create new rewards. Journals could badge well reported articles. EQUATOR could offer a certification service. Funders could reward good reporting financially. Institutions could offer prizes.

Stakeholders could create spaces for authors to discuss reporting and reporting guidelines. These could be online (forums, social media, email) or offline (meet-ups, clubs). Authors could use these spaces to solicit help, share experiences, and provide feedback to guideline developers. Being able to provide feedback may help cultivate a feeling of community ownership.

stage: ongoing
---

Stakeholders could create new acquisition channels to reach authors at earlier stages of work. Funders and ethics committees could create automated email campaigns to prompt researchers at early stages. The EQUATOR website could have dedicated user journeys for planning and drafting research. Web resources could be optimised for search terms like "protocol", "research plan" or "funding application".

<!-- #ASK Olga: is this negative education? -->

Reporting guidance could encourage transparent reporting irregardless of design choices. Recommending or admonishing design choices elongates guidelines and risks shaming researchers making them _less_ likely to report transparently. Guideline developers that wish to impart good design practice can consider linking to design and appraisal resources elsewhere.

barrier_ids: [feel-transparent, feel-patronized, believed-benefits]

---

Stakeholders could use language and design to communicate confidence and simplicity as opposed to to judgement and complexity, and reassure authors that _all_ research has limitations that can be addressed in Discussion sections. Developers could reassure authors when guidelines are _just_ guidelines, and could encourage explanation even when choices were unusual or sub-optimal.

Stakeholders could create tools for different tasks e.g., discussion points for planning research, to-do lists for conducting research, templates for drafting, checklists for checking manuscripts, tools for generating tables and figures, and suggested ctrl-F keywords for reviewers assessing reporting.

---

Guideline resources should link to related resources. For example, checklists should link to example and elaboration documents. Related RGs should link to each other. All resources could all be hosted somewhere consistent with a search function that is easy to use. Links should be permanent (e.g. DOIs) where possible, and all stakeholder_ids should ensure old URLs are maintained or redirected to avoid broken links. Web pages could all be optimized for search engines.

Guideline names could be descriptive, as acronyms may be meaningless to novice users. Related guidelines could use consistent names and terms to show relationships (e.g. the names PRISMA and PRISMA-P appear more related than CONSORT and SPRIT).

Funders, ethics committees, institutions and publishers could endorse reporting guidelines and, where possible, enforce their use either by enforcing checklists or (preferably) adherence to the guidelines directly.

Organise information so it is easy to navigate and not overwhelming. Cater read from start to finish, but others will dip in and out. Structure text with headings. For information presented online, consider showing/hiding information as required, and use section URLs to send authors directly to relevant parts of guidance. Embed or hyperlink related resources.

stage: development
---

For each item, an author needs to know the following:

* What needs to be reported
* State why the information is important, and to whom
* Any circumstances where the item is not applicable and what to write
* Indicate priority, and any circumstances that modify importance
* Where the item can be reported, including beyond the main article body (e.g., section, table, figure, appendix)
* What to write if an item wasn’t, or couldn’t be done
* What to write if an item cannot be reported for external reasons
* Examples of good and bad reporting with explanations
* Links to external design or appraisal advice

Journals, funders and ethics committees can make RGs appear as a priority by prominently mentioning them early in author instructions, by placing checklists earlier in compiled PDFs, and by publicizing when RGs are used by reviewers.

All stakeholder_ids can promote RGs on and offline. Online may include websites, email campaigns, social media, and blogs. Offline may include appearing at conferences.

Institutions could promote RGs in their curricula, learning materials, or through [reporting champions](#sec-reporting-champions). Guideline developers or EQUATOR could push for RGs to be included in text books.

NB. Promotion is different to endorsement; a journal could run an email campaign to promote RGs without having an endorsement policy.

For each RG, authors need the following information:

* A clear definition of the RGs intended scope in plain language.
* If-then rules to direct authors to other, more appropriate guidelines.
* What tasks the RG can and cannot be used for
* Why reporting is the responsibility of the author
* How long the resource will take to use
* Why the guidance should be trusted and link to how it was developed

Keep guidance as a short as possible. Be concise but clear. Be realistic about what to expect from authors as each additional item increases the chances an author will be put off. Link to longer guidance elsewhere if desired.

Testimonials can be short quotes or longer case studies. They could come from:

* from research consumers explaining the impact that (missing) information.
* from decision makers (e.g., editors/grant managers) explaining that they value good reporting and/or explaining how they check for reporting as part of their evaluation.
* From peer reviewers explaining how they use RGs to check for good reporting.
* From other researchers (including nervous ones) about their positive experiences of using RGs.

Authors may benefit from guideline specific education or training. Students could learn the importance of good reporting, and good workflows for documenting and communication research, and how to think about writing as a process. Students could attempt a replication or be asked to use a RG as part of their studies. These could be delivered on or offline, as education or training.
