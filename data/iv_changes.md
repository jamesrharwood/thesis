* When authors first encounter guidelines they may need to know:
  * what RGs are
  * how and when to use them
  * why authors should use them, including:
    * what personal benefits to expect
    * the importance to others.

* Descriptions could be succinct (e.g. on journal instruction pages) or long (e.g. in publications) ^JH^
* A generalised description can go where authors first encounter RGs e.g., journal author guidelines, EQUATOR's home page.
* A guideline specific description could go at the top of guideline resources.
  * Consider specifying whether the guideline is also a design guideline.
  * Specify whether the guidelines are _just_ guidelines, or whether they are intended to be requirements. Name the resource appropriately - words like _guideline_, _standards_, _criteria_, _recommended_, _preferred_, and _templates_, have different meanings.

* Include options beyond the article body, like tables, figures, or appendices be.

* To avoid duplicating resources, before commencing a new RG:
  * consult EQUATOR's register of guidelines under development;
    * EQUATOR could make this register easier to find and search;
  * contact the developers of related guidelines;
  * journals could ask guideline developers to prove that they have registered their guideline with EQUATOR (like they do for clinical trials).
* When a new RG is justified, build upon existing RGs instead of starting from scratch. This could mean extending or replacing subsets of items instead of publishing a totally new RG.
* Consider making modular guidance, like the Journal Article Reporting Standards for psychology.

Create spaces for authors to discuss reporting and reporting guidelines.

These could be:

* online (forums, social media, email),
* or offline (meet-ups, clubs).

Try to make spaces accessible to researchers from all nationalities, professional disciplines and other demographics. Spaces will allow authors to:

* solicit help,
* share experiences,
* provide feedback to guideline developers,
* and cultivate a feeling of inclusivity and community ownership.

<!-- #ASK Olga: is this negative education? -->

Encourage transparent reporting regardless of design choices.

Avoid recommending or admonishing design choices within the reporting guidance because:

* doing so may make authors feel nervous or ashamed, and therefore _less_ likely to report transparently;
* design advice elongates reporting guidelines;
* including design advice may give the impression that the guideline is for designing or appraising design.

Consider linking to external design or appraisal tools instead.

* Use language and design to communicate confidence and simplicity as opposed to judgement and complexity.
* Encourage explanation even when choices were unusual or sub-optimal.
* Reassure authors that most research has limitations that can be addressed in Discussion sections.
* Reassure authors that guidelines are _just_ guidelines.
* Avoid patronizing authors.
* Consider wording instructions directly at the intended user.^JH^

* to-do lists for conducting research in the order data is collected
* templates for drafting
* writing assistance tools (e.g., COBWEB)
* checklists for checking manuscripts that are easy to fill out, update, and cross-check
* tools for co-researchers to check each other's work
* tools for generating tables and figures
* resources for peer reviewers who wish to review reporting quality including:
  * guidance specifically for peer reviewers.
  * commonly-used words that reviewers can search for to quickly find relevant text.^JH^
  * suggested text that peer reviewers can copy to request information
  * tools to generate feedback reports
* journal articles where reporting guideline items are annotated/highlighted

stage: creation

Link resources:

* Ensure all resources link to each other. For example, checklists should link to example and elaboration documents and vice versa.
* Related guidelines should link to each other.
* Guidelines and resources should link to translations
* Links should be permanent (e.g. DOIs) where possible and old links should be maintained or redirected. Broken links should be replaced.

Make searching easy:

* Host resources somewhere consistent
* Provide easy-to-use website search functions
* Web pages should be optimized for search engines ^JH^
* Created curated collections for study types
* Create decision tools for identifying RGs

Names RGs to make them easy to discover and find:

* Guideline names could be descriptive, as acronyms may be meaningless to novice users.
* Related guidelines should use consistent names to show relationships (e.g. PRISMA and PRISMA-P appear more related than CONSORT and SPRIT).

Organise information so it is easy to navigate and not overwhelming.

* Cater to users that read from start to finish, and those that dip in and out.
* Structure text with headings.
* Use section URLs to send authors directly to relevant parts of guidance.
* Consider hyperlinking related resources
* Consider embedding guidelines that "fit together", like PRISMA and PRISMA-Abstracts
* For information presented online, consider showing/hiding information as required. For example, if PRISMA-Abstracts were embedded into PRISMA, users could choose to expand or collapse it. Or you could show/hide guidance depending on whether the author is writing a funding application, protocol, manuscript.

For each item, authors may need to know the following:

* What needs to be reported – a brief description could go in all resources (checklists, templates etc) with a longer description in the guidance itself.
* Why the information is important, and to whom
* Any circumstances where the item is not applicable and what to write
* Indicate priority, and any circumstances that modify importance
* Where the item can be reported, including beyond the main article body (e.g., section, table, figure, appendix)
* What to write if an item wasn’t, or couldn’t be done
* What to write if an item cannot be reported for external reasons
* Examples, which could be real or generated, including:
  * examples of good _and_ bad reporting with explanations.
  * examples of concise or word-count-friendly reporting, perhaps in alternative formats like tables and figures.^JH^
  * examples of well reported "imperfect" items (items that were not done)
  * examples from different research contexts
* Links to external design or appraisal advice

  * Offline may include appearing at conferences, seminars, and workshops.
* Institutions could promote RGs in their curricula, learning materials, or through [reporting champions](#sec-reporting-champions). Guideline developers or EQUATOR could push for RGs to be included in text books.
* Promotion can begin before a guideline has been published so that researchers know about guidelines being developed.

NB. Promotion is different to endorsement; a journal could run an email campaign to promote RGs without having an endorsement policy.

For each RG, authors may need the following information:

* A clear definition of the RGs intended scope in plain language.
* If-then rules to direct authors to other, more appropriate guidelines.
* If no better guidance exists (e.g. there is no protocol guidance) then indicate which items do/do not apply.
* What tasks the RG can and cannot be used for
* How long the resource will take to use
* Why the guidance should be trusted and link to how it was developed

Keep guidance as a short as possible:

* Be concise but clear.
* Be realistic about what to expect from authors as each additional item increases the chances an author will be put off
* Link to other guidance elsewhere if desired.
* Consider splitting broad guidance that tries to cater for different options into shorter, modular guidance (modularity avoids duplication).

Testimonials can be short quotes or longer case studies. They could come from:

* researchers who have had positive experiences using RGs, including researchers that were nervous about transparency,
* decision makers (e.g., editors/grant managers) that value good reporting and/or check for reporting as part of their evaluation,
* peer reviewers that use RGs to check for good reporting,
* patients who are affected by research waste,

Provide guideline-specific education or training (e.g., courses, videos). More generally, students could:

* learn about writing as a process and workflows for documenting and communicating research,
* learn about research waste from poor reporting,^JH^
* attempt a replication to learn about the importance of complete reporting,

Update guidance in response to user feedback or changes in the field. This would be easier if:

* guideline developers could easily collect feedback from authors.
* small updates or refinements could be made without publishing a new article.
* guideline developers had funding to evaluate, refine, and update their resources.^JH^
