id: value-statement
title: Display value statement
barrier_ids: [what-are-rgs, when-to-use, benefits, importance]
intervention_fn_ids: [education]
---

Summarize what RGs are, how and when to use them, what personal benefits to expect, and the importance to others.

A generalised statement could go wherever authors are likely to first encounter RGs e.g., journal author guidelines, EQUATOR's home page. A guideline specific statement could go at the top of guideline resources.

---

id: ready-to-use
title: Ready to use resources
barrier_ids: [need-usable-formats]
intervention_fn_ids: [environmental-restructuring]
---

Ensure all resources are in ready-to-use formats (e.g. Word files) as opposed to e.g., checklists as tables within published articles that have to be copied by the user.

---

id: accessible
title: Accessible resources
barrier_ids: [need-accessible]
intervention_fn_ids: [enablement]

Ensure all resources are open access. This allows access to authors without journal subscriptions and allows others to build upon the guidance.

---

id: citation
title: Citing RGs
barrier_ids: [what-rgs-exist, believed-benefits]
intervention_fn_ids: [education, persuasion]
---

Display citation data alongside the guidelines as a form of social proof. Encourage authors to cite the guideline so readers discover it.

Authors could cite the exact version of the guideline as guidance may change over time. This will become more important if guideline developers begin to make incremental updates to guidance.

id: avoid-prescribing-structure
title: Avoid Prescribing Structure
barrier_ids: [need-to-reconcile, need-concise-writing]
intervention_fn_ids: [education]
---

Avoid prescribing structure as it may clash with journal guidelines or other reporting guidelines. Instead, give options for where items can be reported including options beyond the article body (e.g. tables, figures, appendices).

relation_ids: [information-architecture, easy-understand]
---

Developers should build on top of existing resources instead of re-inventing the wheel. Extend or replace subsets of items instead of publishing a totally new guideline. Broad guidance that tries to cater to multiple research types can be split into shorter, related guidelines (e.g. STROBE being split into STROBE Cohort, STROBE Case-control and STROBE Cross-section). Consider making guidance modular, like the Journal Article Reporting Standards for psychology.

Prospective guideline developers should consult EQUATOR's register of guidelines under development and contact the developers of related guidelines before commencing.

Funders and research supervisors could encourage applicants to allocate sufficient time and money for documenting and reporting results.

---

id: easy-understand
title: Make RGs easy to understand
barrier_ids: [understanding, need-translations]
intervention_fn_ids: [education, enablement]
---

Guideline developers should make their resources easy to understand. This requires updating guidance in response to user feedback. Developers could use plain language, define key terms, use consistent terms across related resources, and provide translations.

---

id: create-early-guidance
title: Create guidance for earlier stages of work
barrier_ids: [need-tools, need-right-time]
intervention_fn_ids: [education]

Guideline developers could create more guidance for earlier stages of work (e.g., protocols, funding applications).

---

id: create-rewards
title: Create Rewards
barrier_ids: [believed-benefits]
intervention_fn_ids: [incentivization, persuasion]

Stakeholders could create new rewards. Journals could badge well reported articles. EQUATOR could offer a certification service. Funders could reward good reporting financially. Institutions could offer prizes.

---

id: create-spaces
title: Create discussion spaces
barrier_ids: [understanding, feel-patronized]
intervention_fn_ids: [enablement, persuasion]
---

Stakeholders could create spaces for authors to discuss reporting and reporting guidelines. These could be online (forums, social media, email) or offline (meet-ups, clubs). Authors could use these spaces to solicit help, share experiences, and provide feedback to guideline developers. Being able to provide feedback may help cultivate a feeling of community ownership.

title: Create ways to catch authors earlier
barrier_ids: [need-prompts, need-right-time]
intervention_fn_ids: [environmental-restructuring]

---

Stakeholders could create new acquisition channels to reach authors at earlier stages of work. Funders and ethics committees could create automated email campaigns to prompt researchers at early stages. The EQUATOR website could have dedicated user journeys for planning and drafting research. Web resources could be optimised for search terms like "protocol", "research plan" or "funding application".

title: Keep RGs agnostic to design choices
barrier_ids: [feel-restricted, feel-transparent]
intervention_fn_ids: [education]
relation_ids: [keep-short, value-statement]
---

<!-- #ASK Olga: is this negative education? -->

Reporting guidance could encourage transparent reporting irregardless of design choices. Recommending or admonishing design choices elongates guidelines and risks shaming researchers making them _less_ likely to report transparently. Guideline developers that wish to impart good design practice can consider linking to design and appraisal resources elsewhere.

---

id: persuade
title: Use persuasive language and design
barrier_ids: [feel-transparent, feel-patronized, believed-benefits]
intervention_fn_ids: [persuasion]
---

Developers could use language and design to communicate confidence and simplicity as opposed to to judgement and complexity. Developers could reassure authors when guidelines are _just_ guidelines, and could encourage explanation even when choices were unusual or sub-optimal. Developers could reassure authors that _all_ research has limitations that can be addressed in Discussion sections.

---

id: create-tools
title: Create tools
barrier_ids: [need-tools, need-right-time]
intervention_fn_ids: [enablement]
---

Guideline developers or EQUATOR could create tools for different tasks e.g., discussion points for planning research, to-do lists for conducting research, templates for drafting, checklists for checking manuscripts, tools for generating tables and figures, and suggested ctrl-F keywords for reviewers assessing reporting.

---

id: findable-resources
title: Ensure resources are easy to discover and find
barrier_ids: [what-rgs-exist, what-resources-exist, need-findable]
intervention_fn_ids: [environmental-restructuring]
---

Guideline resources should link to related resources. For example, checklists should link to example and elaboration documents. Related RGs should link to each other. All resources could all be hosted somewhere consistent with a search function that is easy to use. Links should be permanent (e.g. DOIs) where possible, and all stakeholders should ensure old URLs are maintained or redirected to avoid broken links. Web pages could all be optimized for search engines.

Guideline names could be descriptive, as acronyms may be meaningless to novice users. Related guidelines could use consistent names and terms to show relationships (e.g. the names PRISMA and PRISMA-P appear more related than CONSORT and SPRIT).

Evidence any stated benefits. Experiential benefits could be evidenced by testimonials (e.g. feeling confident, easier writing, value to readers). Quantifiable benefits could be evidenced with data (e.g., acceptance rates, publishing speed, writing speed).

---

id: information-architecture
title: Information architecture TODO
barrier_ids: [need-enough-time]
intervention_fn_ids: [enablement]
relation_ids: [item-content]
---

Organise information so it is easy to navigate and not overwhelming. Cater read from start to finish, but others will dip in and out. Structure text with headings. For information presented online, consider showing/hiding information as required, and use section URLs to send authors directly to relevant parts of guidance. Embed or hyperlink related resources.

intervention_fn_ids: [education, persuasion]
---

For each item, an author needs to know the following:

* What needs to be reported
* State why the information is important, and to whom
* Any circumstances where the item is not applicable and what to write
* Indicate priority, and any circumstances that modify importance
* Where the item can be reported, including beyond the main article body (e.g., section, table, figure, appendix)
* What to write if an item wasn’t, or couldn’t be done
* What to write if an item cannot be reported for external reasons
* Examples of good and bad reporting with explanations
* Links to external design or appraisal advice

id: promote
title: Promote RGs

All stakeholders can promote RGs on and offline. Online may include websites, email campaigns, social media, and blogs. Offline may include appearing at conferences.

Institutions could promote RGs in their curricula, learning materials, or through [reporting champions](#sec-reporting-champions). Guideline developers or EQUATOR could push for RGs to be included in text books.

Promotion is different to endorsement; a journal could run an email campaign to promote RGs without having an endorsement policy.

Authors may benefit from guideline specific education or training. Students could learn the importance of good reporting, and good workflows for documenting and communication research, and how to think about writing as a process. Students could attempt a replication or be asked to use a RG as part of their studies. These could be delivered on or offline, as education or training.
