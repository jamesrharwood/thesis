# Notes on this draft {.unnumbered}

:::{.callout}
Here is the working version of my thesis. 

When opening in Word you'll get an error: 

`This document contains fields that may refer to other files. Do you want to update the fields in this document?`

Click Yes, then Update Entire Table. 

If you see anything like "\@something", "**?:something**", or "#SOMETHING" then please ignore. 

Some of the tables and figures aren't rendering nicely yet, especially in Word format. You can ignore that too.

* Acknowledgements
* Glossary

#### Word Count Tallies: 

Actual word count is ~15k lower as these numbers include references and appendices.
