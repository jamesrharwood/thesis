Firstly, I expected that input from experts with intimate knowledge of reporting guidelines would lead to more ideas and, secondly, I expected these ideas to be more likely to gain traction and have impact.\n\nI had to be mindful of how much time I could expect stakeholders to give to my project. The eight stages outlined by Michie et al. would take many hours and require background familiarity with the COM-B model, intervention functions and policy categories. The best place to start was with members of the UK EQUATOR Center, with whom I already had a relationship, and who were already invested in the project. (See chapter {{< var chapters.reflexivity-and-context >}} for an introduction to the EQUATOR Network, and see chapters {{< var chapters.focus-groups >}} and {{< var chapters.pilot >}} for how I sought input from wider stakeholders and authors.)\n\nIn this chapter, I describe how I led members of the UK EQUATOR Centre through the eight stages of the intervention design process from the Behaviour Change Wheel, and the outcomes of each stage. \n\n## Methods and Results\n\nI invited {{< var counts.EQUATOR_staff_invited >}} members of the UK EQUATOR Center to take part in the workshops, of whom {{< var counts.EQUATOR_staff >}} met {{< var counts.EQUATOR_meetings >}} times between December 2021 and May 2022. Each meeting lasted around 2 hours. I took part in the workshops myself because I felt justified drawing on my own experience from my earlier PhD work, as an author, and developer of tools to help authors (see chapter {{< var chapters.reflexivity-and-context >}}).\n\nThus I took an active role in the workshops, and workshop members completed exercises through discussion. My paradigm was constructivist in that knowledge was \"constructed between inquirer and participant through the inquiry process itself\"@m.givenSAGEEncyclopediaQualitative2008. Constructivism \"rejects the idea that there is objective knowledge in some external reality for the researcher to retrieve mechanistically\" and instead, \"the researcher's values and dispositions influence the knowledge that is constructed through interaction with the phenomenon and participants in the inquiry\"@m.givenSAGEEncyclopediaQualitative2008. \n\nOn one hand this is an asset, as I expected that my experience would contribute to our aim of understanding and addressing the phenomena we were interested in. On the other hand, I wanted to ensure that my opinions didn't bias the group, I wanted us all to remain open-minded, and I wanted to accurately capture the opinions and ideas of other workshop participants. And so I used a number of established techniques to facilitate open and rich discussion and to enhance trustworthiness. \n\nTo encourage discussion, I encouraged participants to rise above their own preconceptions and reassured them that there were no wrong answers (#TODO: name and cite). I used open-ended questioning and left space for participants to talk (#TODO: name and cite). All ideas were considered valid and were documented. The behaviour change wheel encourages rich discussion by breaking up intervention design into stages and by using frameworks, models, and taxonomies. \n\nTo enhance trustworthiness, I used Lincoln and Guba's criteria for trustworthiness @lincolnNaturalisticInquiry1985, which asserts that for for a study to be trustworthy, the researcher must show that the findings are credible ('true'), transferable (applicable to other contexts), dependable (consistent and repeatable), and confirmable (shaped by participants, not by the researcher's bias or motivation). I describe the techniques I used to achieve each criteria in @tbl-trust.\n\n**Technique**                                   | Implementation\n------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Techniques for establishing credibility**     |\n*Member-checking*                               | Lincoln and Guba argue that member checking is the most important way to the establish validity of an account @lincolnNaturalisticInquiry1985. All workshop participants could edit the worksheets during and after each workshop. At the end of each session, I would invite workshop participants to confirm that their thoughts were reflected in the file, and I invited participants to comment on my written account of the workshops.\n**Techniques for establishing transferability** |\n*Thick description*                             | I encouraged participants to describe ideas in detail and to document disagreement and context.

I would invite participants to consider the worksheet on their own or in pairs. I did this so that everybody would engage with the task and have an opportunity to think before being influenced by others. We then discussed ideas as a group, with members agreeing, disagreeing, and bouncing off each other. I withheld my own ideas until the end of a session or task, whereupon I would invite discussion on any ideas that I felt hadn't been covered already. This allowed me to contribute my experience from previous PhD work, as an author, and as a software developer and give others a chance to discuss my thoughts, without biasing or narrowing discussion.\n*Audit trail*                                   | All worksheets were stored on the University One Drive account which performs automatic saves and versioning.

I will now summarise each step and our discussions. I purposefully use \"we\" in this chapter instead of \"participants\" to reflect that my voice is included.\n\n## 1. Defining the problem in behavioural terms \n\nThe first step is to define _who_ needs to do _what_. Michie et al. suggest describing what the behaviour is, where it occurs, and who performs it. We were all in alignment here: we want researchers to include important details in their articles, in line with the relevant reporting guidelines. This behaviour will occur at the place of work (e.g., University, hospitals, at home) and will be performed by anybody writing about biomedical research.\n\n## 2. Select target behaviour\n\n\"Behaviours do not exist in a vacuum but occur within the context of other behaviours of the same or other individuals\" write Michie et al. @michieBehaviourChangeWheel2014, when explaining that the desired behaviour needn't be the  behaviour that you target. For instance, if you want a child to eat more fruit (desired behaviour), you may seek to influence what food their parent buys (target behaviour).\n\nStep 2 involves generating a long list of candidate target behaviours that could bring about the desired behaviour. We ended up with 18 ideas, many of which targeted the author directly such as \"reading the guidance in full\" or \"studying guidance (in an abstract sense)\". This exercise helped us break down researcher's writing process and consider how they could \"use guidance when planning\", \"drafting\", \"editing [their own work]\", or \"checking\". We considered how these behaviours required researchers' to be open to assistance and wondered if we could encourage them to \"ask for help when writing\".\n\nWe also considered targeting people other than authors. For instance, \"peer reviewers\" and \"editors\" could \"check articles against guidelines [and] tell authors what is missing\", and supervisors could \"encourage\" the use of guidelines.\n\nWe began to break down what we meant by \"guidance\" and decided that we wanted people to use the _full_ guidance (often reported in an _Example &Elaboration_ document) and \"not just the checklist\".\n\nThe next step was to select a behaviour from the long list by considering:\n\n1. The expected impact if the behaviour were to be performed\n2. How easy we expected behaviour change to be\n3. The centrality of behaviour - how close it was to our desired behaviour\n4. How easy the behaviour will be to measure\n\nCriteria 2 and 3 lead us to focus on the behaviour of authors above that of editors or peer reviewers. When considering criteria 1, we felt that authors were most likely to act on guidance if they used it early when writing. Just _how_ early depended on the guideline and discipline; for example, protocols are common in some disciplines and some guidelines cater for this (e.g. SPIRIT, PRISMA-P). But other disciplines don't typically have a protocol culture, and some guidelines are harder to use for writing protocols than others. Because we wanted our intervention to be transferable between reporting guidelines, we decided not to specify a stage of work and to use the term \"early as possible\" instead.\n\n## 3. Specify the target behaviour\n\nHaving decided that we wanted \"authors to use the full guidance as early as possible\" it was time to specify this behaviour in more detail. Michie et al. suggest defining _who_ needs to perform the behaviour, _what_ do they need to do, _when_ will they do it, _where_ will they do it, how _often_ will they do it, and _with whom_?\n\n\nOur final definition of our target behaviour was: **Researchers should use reporting guidance as early as possible in their research pipeline. They will do this for every piece of research, at their place of work, on their own but in the context of collaboration**\n\nParticipants broke this key behaviour into two sub behaviours:\n\n1. Engage with reporting guidelines as early as possible (ie access and read them) and,\n2. Apply the guidance to their writing as intended by the guideline developer.\n\nBy \"research pipeline\" we mean the many steps involved in a typical project which may include ideation, obtaining funding and ethics permission, designing, writing a protocol, drafting a manuscript, editing a manuscript, submitting a manuscript. Instead of specifying _which_ stage reporting guidance should be used, we decided to specify that we want authors to use guidance as \"early as possible\". We did this for a few reasons. Firstly, guidelines differ in how easily they can be used for writing protocols or applications. Secondly, researchers will naturally come across reporting guidelines at different stages of their work. Should a researcher discover a guideline at the point of journal submission, then we would still want them to apply the guidance then, even though this is a relatively late stage. But by specifying \"as early as possible\", we declare our hope that _next time_ that same researcher may decide to use a guideline at an earlier point. And finally, not all research projects will begin with a written funding application, ethics application, or protocol.\n\nBy \"apply\", we refer to using guidance to plan, write or edit a written description of research (e.g. within a manuscript or application). Applying guidance includes the use of tools like templates or checklists. Participants discussed specifying \"completing a reporting checklist\" as a target behaviour, but decided against it as previous research showed that authors who complete checklists upon submission don't necessarily edit their manuscript or comply with guidelines. Participants also recognised that focussing on checklists may be problematic because checklists appear administrative, are used _after_ a manuscript has been written, at which point authors are least able or motivated to edit their work. Nevertheless, participants recognised that checklists will continue to be an important part of how reporting guidance are disseminated, and so they are included within the term \"apply the guidance\", without being named.\n\nWe felt it important to specify that guidance should be applied \"as intended by the guideline developer\" as my previous research showed that sometimes authors who misinterpret guidelines may believe that they are adhering when they are not.\n\nHence our target behaviour definition specifies the _who_, _what_, _when_, and _where_ but is broad enough to account for differences between researchers' working practices, research projects, and reporting guidelines.\n\n## 4. Identify what needs to change\n\nThis step involved identifying what needs to change in the person and/or environment to achieve our target behaviour. Michie et al provide a questionnaire to facilitate this step, called the _COM-B Questionnaire_, which asks you to consider each COM-B domain in turn and to consider 23 items like \"To perform the target behaviour, authors would have to know more about why it was important\", \"know more about how to do it\", \"have more time to do it\", and \"have more support from others\" etc.\n\nMichie et al. emphasise the importance of evidence in this step, recommending that data should be \"collected from as many relevant sources as possible\" and \"triangulated\", as a consistent picture of behaviour from multiple sources will \"increase confidence in the analysis\"@michieBehaviourChangeWheel2014. Consequently, we included all of the factors that I identified from my previous PhD work (see chapters {{< var chapters.synthesis >}}-{{< var chapters.journal-audit >}}) and labelled each as being driven by capability, opportunity, or motivation. \n\nThe result was a set of {{< var counts.barriers >}} factors that we felt needed to change for our target behaviour to occur. These can be seen in Appendix {{< var appendices.barriers >}}.\n\n## 5 & 6. Identify Intervention Functions and Policy Categories\n\n#TODO: introduce these stages a bit more.\n\nMichie et al. @michieBehaviourChangeWheel2014 recommend using the APEASE criteria to prioritze options, which stands for Affordability, Practicability, Efficacy, Acceptability, Side-effects, and Equity. \n\nWe saw Enablement, Education, Training, Persuasion, Modelling, and Environmental Restructuring as ranking favourably on all APEASE criteria. Of these, Enablement was viewed as a particularly low-hanging fruit that would likely be effective and welcomed by the research community.\n\nWe found the remaining intervention functions problematic. Incentivization and restriction (e.g. rewarding guideline adherence with funding or reduced article processing, or punishing non-adherence by withholding these benefits) were seen as inequitable because as long as guideline adherence is harder for some researchers than others, less-experienced, poorly resourced researchers would be at a disadvantage, as would those working in disciplines where reporting guidelines are poorly designed or harder to apply. Conversely, we felt that enablement has potential to reduce existing inequalities. In addition to being inequitable, participants voiced that restriction or punishment would be unacceptable to researchers, as would coercion (the threat of punishment). Furthermore, threats without enforcement could become known as paper tigers, lose effectiveness, and erode trust.\n\nRegarding Policy Categories, we saw environmental planning as the most affordable, effective, acceptable, safe, and equitable. When talking about the _environment_, we were really talking about the _digital_ environment, within which EQUATOR has control over its own website but not websites or digital services run by others. Improving and extending the website was viewed as an affordable investment, that would be welcomed by authors (thus acceptable), and a practical way to increase the proportion of authors engaging with reporting guidelines that would increase equity without side effects.\n\nWe recognised communication as a favourable policy category that is already utilised. Communication channels included the website, mailing lists, social media, conferences, and publications. Whilst communication was rated as affordable, practicable, acceptable, safe, and equitable, its effectiveness may be limited. Although communication could promote awareness of reporting guidelines are available, what they are, and how they can be used, EQUATOR members noted that the efficacy of a communications campaign may be undermined if the campaign is directing authors to a website that is difficult to use, or guidelines that are difficult to access or understand. Thus communication on its own might not be sufficient, and members suggested that it should come after improving the digital environment.\n\nService provision was also favoured, as long as the service was financially sustainable. So too where guidelines, specifically guidance to help reporting guideline developers create and disseminate resources. Participants felt that Legislation, Regulation, and Fiscal Measures would not be acceptable to researchers and were not not practical options for EQUATOR to use.\n\n## 7. Identify behaviour change techniques\n\n#TODO: Explain why I didn't follow the book here. Explain what I did instead. Explain that I opened it up to other stakeholders and to see the next chapter - Focus Groups. Explain that I did the behavioural analysis after the focus groups and point to results in the Redesign chapter.\n\n## 8. Identifying delivery options\n\nI then had to decide how to deliver our favoured intervention functions and policy options. Michie et al.'s guidance for this step is more open ended@michieBehaviourChangeWheel2014; although they offer delivery options for communication as an example intervention function, there is no framework or systematic approach to this step and instead they recommend that designers consider the delivery options that they have at their disposal. For EQUATOR, that meant developing a new service or training programme, running a communication campaign, developing new guidance, or improving their website. It was important that my choice was doable within my funding window, and I wanted it to have a lasting impact after my DPhil was finished.\n\nCreating a new service felt unsustainable as it would likely stop once my funding ran out. Developing training or guidance for guideline developers could be useful and acceptable but not achievable within my time constraint. I could have developed a communications campaign, but EQUATOR members felt this was something they could do independently and that it should be done after addressing other barriers.\n\nInstead, refining and extending the existing EQUATOR website felt like the perfect choice for multiple reasons. Firstly, planning the digital environment was ranked most highly as a policy category. Secondly, the website can be used as a means of delivering many of the highly ranked intervention functions (enablement, education, persuasion, modelling). Thirdly, it spoke to my skills as a software developer and is something that the UK EQUATOR staff could not do on their own. And finally, these changes could be made within the time limit of my PhD and, importantly, the impact would be sustained after I finish.\n\n## Discussion\n\nMy EQUATOR colleagues found the exercise incredibly useful and motivating. The process got everybody thinking about reporting guidelines not just as a set of documents or standards, but as a complex behaviour change intervention. It also helped us challenge our preconceptions. One of the most interesting parts of this process was witnessing an unexpected change of opinion amongst EQUATOR staff. Before beginning this study, a common refrain heard around the office was that in order for reporting guidelines to be successful editors had to start enforcing them and refuse to publish research that didn't adhere. So it was fascinating to see that workshop participants unanimously rated restriction and coercion as their least favourite options.\n\nI think two things happened here. Firstly, having discussed the barriers that authors face when trying to use reporting guidelines, participants felt that forcing authors to use them would be unacceptable to authors, impractical for editors, and inequitable as some authors would face larger hurdles than others. Secondly, participants reassessed things they had taken for granted, and realised that there are many low-hanging fruit that could make guidelines easier to find and use, and that these fruit were growing in their own orchard.\n\n#TODO: more discussion!\n\n## References\n\n::: {#refs}\n:::\n\n# Ideas to address factors limiting reporting guideline impact: focus groups with developers, publishers, and experts\n\n\n# Introduction\n\nIn chapter {{< var chapters.bcw >}} I described the Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW) framework for designing behavioural interventions @michieBehaviourChangeWheel2011. In {{< var chapters.workshops >}} I summarised the stages recommended in Michie et al.'s accompanying book @michieBehaviourChangeWheel2014 for using the framework to develop interventions. I also described the additions that I made to step 7 of this approach where, in addition to considering each behaviour change technique for each desired change myself (as recommended), I also asked EQUATOR UK staff to brainstorm ideas more loosely. I did this because considering 93 techniques for {{ var counts.barriers }} was too time consuming to do as a group, and EQUATOR staff did not have time to become familiar with the behaviour change technique taxonomy. The result of this brainstorm was a list of {{< var counts.EQUATOR_ideas >}} ideas. In this chapter, I describe how I extended this list of ideas by seeking input from the broader reporting guideline community into this ideation phase.\n\nI did this because, although EQUATOR staff have a lot of experience in reporting guidelines (which I describe in chapter {{< var chapters.workshops >}}), the group is small and close-knit. Whilst EQUATOR is a key part of the reporting guideline landscape, they are _only_ a part of it. Ultimately, all stakeholders within the academic system influence the impact of reporting guidelines. Guideline developers and publishers arguably do so most directly currently, and so it was important to draw on their experience and opinions. \n\nIt wasn't feasible to include these stakeholders through all stages of the BCW approach as a) the time commitment was too great, b) it would have required stakeholders to become familiar with the framework and its terminologies which was too big an ask. \n\nIn contrast, adding an idea-generating step provided a good opportunity to include stakeholders. Stakeholders could contribute and discuss ideas in a short amount of time and without having to study the Behaviour Change Wheel or behaviour change technique taxonomy. In this chapter, I describe how I gathered ideas from guideline developers, publishers, and other experts.\n\n<!-- # ASK Charlotte: is the objective clear, justified, and sign posted? -->\n<!-- Although some EQUATOR members have developed reporting guidelines, their experience may not be representative of \"external\" guideline developers who, despite having a deep understanding of their own guidance, may consider reporting guidelines as a small part of their academic identity and may not \"live and breathe\" reporting guidelines in the same way EQUATOR does. -->\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Methods\n\nThe purpose of this study was to elicit ideas from experts familiar with RG dissemination, on how to address barriers and facilitators that may influence the application of (and thereby adherence to) reporting guidance. Focus groups are researcher-led group discussions that use conversation as a form of data collection@givenFocusGroups2008. A key element of focus groups is interactions between participants as they agree, disagree, challenge, and 'feed off' of each other. I chose focus groups because I expected this interaction to lead to more ideas being generated than if I interviewed participants in isolation. Focus groups are also a practical way to collect data from larger groups of people. This is in contrast to in-depth interviews which are more useful in eliciting detail about individuals' perspectives.\n\n<!-- # ASK CA recommended a quote. Is quote necessary? -->\n\n## Sampling\n\nI invited a purposive sample including the developers of popular reporting guidelines, publishing professionals, and academics that have studied reporting guidelines. I asked participants to extend the invite to others they felt would be appropriate. Because the BCW requires input from experts with insight into the intervention, I decided to elicit the opinions of authors in a separate study (see chapter {{< var chapters.pilot >}}).\n\nFollowing best-practice, I used information power@malterudSampleSizeQualitative2016, developed by Malterud et al., to guide my estimated sample size. Malterud et al. posit that the more relevant information a sample holds, the fewer participants are needed. They argue that whether a sample size is sufficient depends on five factors: 1) whether the study's aim is narrow or broad, 2) whether samples are considered dense (they have a lot of relevant experience or knowledge of the phenomena) or sparse, 3) whether the study is well supported by theory, 4) the quality of dialogue, and 5) whether data will between compared between participants/groups.\n\nMy aim was narrow and well defined. My sample was dense in that participants knew a lot about how reporting guidance is disseminated but also showed variance in terms of which guidelines they work on and which parts of the academic system they represented. I used the BCW as an applied theory. I used open questioning and to encourage strong dialogue (I elaborate on this later), and I was not planning a cross-case analysis. Therefore, I deemed my information power sufficient to justify initially recruiting 15-20 participants in 4 -5 groups.\n\nI used the dialogue criteria from Information Power to decide when to stop recruiting. By monitoring the number of edits to the co-produced file I could be confident that my information power was good. Once groups began to add fewer and fewer comments, I judged that the benefit of continued recruitment was insufficient given time constraints.\n\n## Materials\n\nIn chapter {{< var chapters.workshops >}} I described how EQUATOR and I generated a list of ideas that could target influences. This \"ideas document\" had two columns: influences were described in the left hand column, and ideas of possible changes in the right hand column. The file can be seen in Appendix {{ var appendices.ideas_document }}. I used this document to prompt discussion in the focus groups. However, because ideas generated by previous participants could bias or limit the creativity of current participants <!-- #ASK CA what bias is this? -->I initially hid them by turning the text in the ideas column white before sharing. I would reveal the text only after participants had exhausted their own imagination (see @fig-ideas-document for an example).\n\n::: {#fig-ideas-document layout-ncol=2}\n![Ideas initially hidden](assets/ideas-doc-b4.png)\n\n![Ideas showing](assets/ideas-doc-after.png)\n\nAn example entry in the Ideas Document that was co-edited by participants. Existing ideas were initially hidden (by turning the text white), and only made visible once participants had discussed their own ideas.\n:::\n\nAll participants could edit this file to record their own ideas or elaborate on other people's ideas. At the end of each focus group, I would then turn the ideas column white again, ready for the next group to continue the process. In this way, each group built upon the output of the previous groups.\n\n## Focus Groups\n\nI conducted focus groups between May-July 2022 online using Zoom. Before each focus group, I asked participants to spend some time thinking about barriers and facilitators. I did this because I wanted participants to get into the frame of mind and come to the focus group \"armed\" with influences they were ready to discuss. I was also interested to see whether participants would contribute influences that I did not identify in chapters {{< var chapters.synthesis >}}-{{< var chapters.journal-audit >}}. \n\nEach focus group lasted 2 hours. I began by introducing myself and the project in a way that I hoped would help participants relax and to think open-mindedly, not defensively. I explained where the list of influences had come from, and that the influences were in reference to reporting guidelines _in general_, and not necessarily a comment on _their_ guideline. I encouraged participants to think beyond the guideline documents themselves, and to consider all stakeholders and resources involved. I explained the goal was to brainstorm as many blue-sky ideas as possible, and not worry about whether ideas were good or bad.\n\nIt was not possible for a single focus group to cover all influences within a reasonable amount of time, so I allowed participants to select which items they wanted to discuss. I did this by giving them a few minutes to read through a list of influences, raise any additional influences they felt were missing, and mark those that they wanted to talk about. I occasionally selected influences to discuss myself, either because they had been neglected by previous groups or because I expected participants to have insight into it.\n\nFor each influence discussed, I would explain it and allow participants to ask questions. I then asked participants to spend a couple of minutes reflecting on the influence and brainstorming solutions on their own before discussing them as a group. I encouraged this solo reflection because I wanted all participants to engage with the problem. \n\nTo facilitate discussion, I would ask open ended questions, often drawing on intervention functions from the BCW by asking questions like \"how could this be easier to do?\" or \"how could we change how people feel about this?\". I did this when participants ran out of ideas, or when they got fixated on a particular type of intervention, in which case I would reassure participants that their fixated solution was already documented and that it would be useful to think of alternatives.\n\nOnce participants had discussed all of their own ideas, I would reveal the ideas identified by previous groups by changing the colour of text from white to black. Participants could then edit and extend the text until it reflected all of their thoughts too. Ideas were never removed from the document, but participants could add concerns or disagreements if they wanted to. \n\nAfter each focus groups I made notes on how the session went and reflected on what I could have done differently. I made a copy of the ideas document and then turned the text in the ideas column white again, ready for the next group. Taking copies after each group created a paper trail of how the document had evolved after each session, and counted the number of additions so that I could monitor how many new ideas had been added and, therefore, whether I could stop data collection. \n<!-- #ASK: CA. Do I need to report the number of added ideas from each group? -->\n\n### Data processing and analysis\n\nI imported the final ideas document into NVivo and applied descriptive codes to ideas. Some sentences contained multiple ideas, each being a single intervention change. Sometimes the same idea appeared against multiple barriers, and most barriers had multiple associated ideas. I also coded the barriers and stakeholders that were related to each idea.\n\n### Data analysis\n\nI used qualitative description for my analysis (@bradshawEmployingQualitativeDescription2017; @kimCharacteristicsQualitativeDescriptive2017), which involved aggregating and summarising ideas. I did not interpret data as doing so would erase the views captured during co-production. I grouped ideas inductively in ways that felt cohesive and made the results easy for my intended audience (the reporting guideline community) to understand and act upon. For example, I aggregated \"ask authors to cite reporting guidelines\" and \"display citation metrics on reporting guideline resources\" into a group about \"Citations\", even though they target different barriers (discoverability and perceived trustworthiness) and employ different intervention functions (education and persuasion). \n<!-- # TODO: ensure wording matches results. -->\nI discussed and refined my coding, aggregating and summarising with JdB. I sent the aggregated, summarised ideas to focus group participants and EQUATOR members, inviting them to add more ideas and to check that it reflected their ideas faithfully. I also invited feedback from guideline developers who had shown an interest in the study but had been unable to attend a focus group.\n\n\n## Reflexivity & Trust\n\nWhereas positivism refers to an objective reality that can be mathematically interpreted and aims to eliminate subjectivity, post-positivists acknowledge that observation is fallible, reality is subjective, and that context and values are necessary to make sense of human experience. My research paradigm was post-positivist, in that I considered that ideas were \"out there\", but that differences in context, experience, and opinion would affect what I (and participants) observed, understood, and concluded.\n<!-- #ASK CA: why was I not constructivist? Constructivists believe that interactions between people / actions are important.  -->\nSubjectivity is a strength - why am I best placed. Could have come with bias so we did xyz.\n\nHaving acknowledged this subjectivity, it was important to mitigate against it so that my results could be trusted. Lincoln and Guba @lincolnNaturalisticInquiry1985 argue that for a study to be trustworthy, the researcher must show that the findings are credible ('true'), transferable (applicable to other contexts), dependable (consistent and repeatable), and confirmable (shaped by participants, not by the researcher's bias or motivation). Lincon and Guba propose a number of techniques to achieve these criteria, and I describe the techniques I used in @tbl-trust.\n\n**Technique**|Implementation\n-------------|--------------\n**Techniques for establishing credibility**|\n*Member-checking*|Lincoln and Guba argue that member checking is the most important way to the establish validity of an account @lincolnNaturalisticInquiry1985. Accordingly, I invited all participants to comment on my synthesised results, asking for feedback on the structure of categories, my interpretation of their data, and my findings and conclusions.

I kept versions of raw data collected from all stages. I made a note of my own ideas before commencing data collection, documented all stages of the workshops I held internally with the EQUATOR Network, and kept copies of the co-produced file after every focus group. I kept a copy of my coding in NVivo, and versions of the unitized information and summaries that I sent to participants before and after member checking. This audit trail meant that I could be certain of which stages of research ideas originated from.\n*Reflexivity*|I wrote down my own ideas before commencing the study (see chapter {{< var chapters.workshops >}}), along with my beliefs and experiences of reporting guidelines.

All data and recordings were kept on secure university storage.\n\n\n\n# Results\n\n## Units of study\n\nI held {{< var counts.focus_groups >}} focus groups involving {{< var counts.participants >}} participants in total. Participants included guideline developers (n={{< var counts.guideline_developers >}}), publishing professionals (n={{< var counts.publishers >}}), and academics that study reporting guidelines (n={{< var counts.academics >}}).\n\nOf the {{< var counts.invitations.guideline_groups.total >}} guideline groups I invited, {{< var counts.invitations.guideline_groups.attended >}} took part. Of the remainder, {{< var counts.invitations.guideline_groups.no_time >}} guideline groups wanted to participate but were unable to coordinate a time, {{< var counts.invitations.guideline_groups.no_response >}} groups did not respond, and {{< var counts.invitations.guideline_groups.denied >}} group refused to participate; they felt that their guideline didn't need updating because it was highly cited.\n\nOf the {{< var counts.invitations.total >}} invitations that I sent in total, {{< var counts.invitations.no_response >}} received no response. But because I invited people to share the invitation (which they did), I have no way of knowing my recruitment rate.\n\nAlthough I had intended to include 4 or 5 participants per focus group, in practice it was difficult to coordinate participants across time zones, and so sessions only had 2 or 3 participants. \n\nBefore the focus groups, my workshops with EQUATOR had generated a list of {{< var counts.EQUATOR_ideas >}} ideas, which formed the initial \"ideas document\" presented to the first focus group. After the final focus group, participants had extended this list further to include {{< var counts.sub_items_pre_jh >}} ideas to address {{< var counts.barriers >}} barriers. Participants identified {{< var counts.stakeholders >}} stakeholders that could enact these ideas including {{< var descriptions.stakeholders >}}.\n\nI grouped these ideas into {{< var counts.ideas >}} broader ideas, which I categorised according to whether they could be considered {{< var descriptions.stages >}}. \n\n## Synthesis and interpretation\n\n### {{< var stages.planning >}}\n\n#### Create reporting guidance for protocols and applications\n\nParticipants suggested \"developing [reporting guidance] for protocols\", funding, and ethics applications as a way to encourage authors to consult reporting guidance earlier in their work when they are more likely to have the time, motivation, and ability to reflect and act on it.\n\nIntervention Functions: Education\n\n#### {{< var IFs.avoid-proliferation >}}\n\n\"We need fewer, better, reporting guidelines\" wrote one participant, when discussing how authors may struggle to identify which reporting guidelines apply to their work. \n\nAcknowledging that reporting guideline developers may duplicate each other's work unwittingly, participants wrote that developers should consult EQUATOR's register of reporting guidelines under development before creating a new guideline. Participants noted that \"EQUATOR cannot prevent guideline developers from creating duplicate guidelines\" but could \"improve the registration process for reporting guidelines that are under development\", better \"highlight [reporting guidelines] that are under development in the main search results\", and could \"create options and instructions to encourage developers to extend existing guidance instead of duplicating. This could go in the new guidance for guideline developers\".\n\nParticipants had ideas of how this \"extend\"ing could be done. Developers could tailor existing guidance to a particular niche by making different \"versions\" or \"extensions\" of existing guidance \"e.g., STROBE split into STROBE Cohort, Case-control etc\". If only a few items need to be edited or added, participants suggested creating \"modular\" guidance instead of duplicating an entire guideline. Participants spoke of modules in two different ways. Firstly, new reporting guidelines can be created to substitute for particular items in existing reporting guidelines. Participants named TIDIER as an example of this strategy, which can be substituted for item 5 in CONSORT. Participants identified a second kind of modularity in the JARS guidelines, where a general reporting guideline covering all quantitative psychology research can be mixed-and-matched by modules for specific designs (non-experimental and experimental designs, with or without random assignment, or special modules for longitudinal, n-of-1, or replication studies @appelbaumJournalArticleReporting2018).\n\nWhen discussing how modules or extensions could be \"harmonized\" so that they \"speak to another\", participants suggested resources could have compatible structure, and should not \"use different wording for what is essentially the same item\". Participant's recommendation to \"use similar terminology [across] related guidelines\" extended to the title; STROBE-nut, STROBE-ME and STROBE-RDS are more readily identifiable as STROBE extensions than STREGA, ROSES-I, or STROME-ID are. Naming can also indicate when a guideline has been revised: \"ARRIVE 2.0 is recognisable as a replacement of ARRIVE\", whereas \"TIDIER Placebo appears to be an extension but should be called TIDIER 2.0\".\n\nIntervention Functions: Enablement\n\n#### {{< var IFs.avoid-prescribing-structure >}}\n\nParticipants noted that \"[reporting] guidelines should avoid prescribing structure as [it] may clash with journal guidelines\".\n\nIntervention Functions: Enablement\n\n#### {{< var IFs.design-agnostic >}}\n\nParticipants discussed how _designing_ research is a separate task to _reporting_ it, and that many authors will only encounter reporting guidelines _after_ the manuscript has been written, at which point design advice is less useful. Nevertheless, participants cited multiple reasons for including design opinions in reporting guidance. Some suggested it should be included so that authors can \"learn for next time\", and others wrote that consequences of design choices justify why an item was important to report, but acknowledged that that justifying items in this way can be problematic if developers do not consider all contexts or study types in which their guidance may be used.\n\nSome participants argued that design advice could be removed from reporting guidelines entirely. This was proposed as a solution when considering how authors may feel afraid to report transparently if what they did goes against the design recommendation, or may feel restricted if forced to use a reporting guideline that prescribes design choices. \n\nInstead, developers could encourage authors to \"explain reasons for methods choices, [which may] be legitimate\", noting that \"the consequence of not choosing one [design] option over another, even if the choice is a rarely used option, may not have major consequence on the results of the study\". One participant wrote that authors may feel reassured if told that \"editors and peer-reviewers may not judge as harshly when they understand the rationale for the choice\". Participants wrote that developers should \"encourage transparent reporting over and above good design\", and that authors could be encouraged to \"describe what they did in plain language to make it clear - if what they did doesn't quite fit with standard terminology (e.g., if they didn't really do theoretical sampling or aren't sure if they did theoretical sampling) then just describe what they did, how they made sampling decisions\".\n\nDiscussions about removing design advice also arose when considering how including design advice elongates guidance, potentially deterring authors from reading it. To solve this, participants suggested reporting guidelines could link to design resources \"elsewhere\". If reporting guidance were presented on a website, authors could be given options to \"display or hide\" design advice by choice, or depending on whether the author was \"designing [research], applying for funding, or drafting\" a manuscript.\n\nIntervention Functions: Enablement, persuasion, (removal of) coercion\n\n#### {{< var IFs.item-content >}}\n\nMany barriers prompted participants to suggest that specific content should be included for every reporting item.\n\nFirstly, participants noted that authors need to know what to write, and that a brief description could go in checklists and a longer description in the full guidance. Participants suggested this description should include what to write if they didn't or couldn't do something to make it \"easy for researchers to report things they are embarrassed about\". In these instances, developers could suggest authors \"explain reasons\" for their choices or \"consider the item in their discussion section as a possible limitation\" if necessary. Participants also wrote that developers could suggest what to write when an item doesn't apply.\n\nBesides knowing what to write, participants suggested explaining \"why [an item] is important and who it is important to\" as this isn't always obvious to authors. To make guidelines faster to use, participants suggested indicating which items are most important, perhaps \"prioritise[ing] certain items as essential vs. recommended, like ARRIVE 2.0 essential 10\" and indicating conditions that make items less or more important, including circumstances that make the item non-applicable.\n\nTo help authors who want to keep writing concise or need to reduce word counts, participants suggested advising \"when an item can be put into a table, figure, box, supplement, or appendix etc\" and to \"explain the pros and cons of different options e.g., whether content will be peer reviewed or indexed\" by search tools.\n\nMany participants suggested including examples to help authors understand and apply guidance. These examples could include both \"good and bad reporting\" with an explanation of \"how [bad reporting] could be improved\". To help authors who are afraid to transparently report limitations, participants suggested including examples of imperfect research that is perfectly-reported. Examples could also include \"reporting in different contexts\", from different disciplines,  \"in multiple languages\", and concise reporting e.g. reporting \"TIDIER items nicely in a table\".\n\nBecause examples from the published literature can be \"difficult to [...] find and list\", participants suggested that developers could create examples themselves, and that examples could be \"real or generated\". Examples should be \"easy to find\" from within the guidance resources. Others suggested a searchable \"bank\" of examples, or ways to showcase \"exemplar papers (e.g., badges)\".\n\nFinally, participants discussed the pros and cons of including item-specific design advice, procedural instructions, and appraisal advice, and the different ways of doing it (see [{{< var IFs.design-agnostic >}}](@sec-{{< var IFSecs.design-agnostic >}})).\n\nIntervention Functions: Education, modelling, persuasion \n\n#### {{< var IFs.rg-introductions >}}\n\nParticipants suggested that reporting guidelines and resources should \"clearly state what kind of research the guidance applies to when considering how authors may struggle to identify which reporting guideline they should use. Additionally, participants wrote suggested guidelines could \"point researchers to other guidelines if more relevant, perhaps using 'if, then' rules e.g., 'if you did X then use Y instead of this guideline'\". If no better guideline exists for a particular type of study, participants suggested to \"warn the user that they can still use this guideline but that they may need to ignore certain questions e.g. 'This guideline is for studies that did X. You can still use it if you did Y, but you will need to ignore items 4, 6, and 8-10'\".\n\nTo ensure that a reporting guideline for writing manuscripts can also be used for writing protocols, developers could specify \"which items need to be considered at protocol/planning stage, and which at results reporting stage.\" \n\nParticipants warned that developers should be mindful when using words like  _standard_ instead of _guideline_ in the title or introduction of a reporting guideline, as these words may influence how prescriptive the user expects the resource to be. In choosing their wording, participants suggested developers should be honest and clear about a guideline's \"aim\". Developers could also \"be clear about what reporting guidelines _are not_. For instance, when they are not design guideline or critical appraisal tools\" this could be specified and authors could be directed to other tools instead.\n\nFinally, participants suggested telling authors how much time the guideline is expected to take them to read and use, why it can be trusted, and where they can read about its development.\n\nIntervention Functions: Education, enablement, persuasion\n\n#### {{< var IFs.keep-short >}}\n\n\"Make guidance shorter\" wrote one participant, and \"Make checklists shorter ;P\", wrote another, when considering how \"guideline length [...] may put researchers off\" as \"long guidelines appear more complex and time consuming\" and can challenge word limits.\n\nOne participant posited that guidelines could be shorter if developers were \"realistic about what they ask for\". Another challenged developers to \"try using a guideline from start to finish and see how the manuscript ends up\". Others felt that guidelines could be shortened by linking out to content that wasn't directly related to reporting, like design or appraisal advice (see [{{< var IFs.design-agnostic >}}](@sec-{{< var IFSecs.design-agnostic >}})). Guidelines that are \"very long or [have] lots of optional items\" could be split into multiple versions (see STROBE as an example in [{{< var IFs.avoid-proliferation >}}](@sec-{{< var IFSecs.avoid-proliferation >}})).\n\nOthers suggested presenting guidance online with non-essential content collapsed so that guidance appeared short but authors could choose to \"display or hide\" it. Participants noted that \"itemisation can make guidance more digestible, but can also make it harder to get the bigger picture\" and makes text appear longer.\n\nIntervention Functions: Enablement\n\n### {{< var stages.development >}}\n\n#### {{< var IFs.ready-to-use >}}\n\nParticipants suggested that resources should be in ready-to-use formats. For instance, \"checklists should be editable (not PDFs)\".\n\nIntervention Functions: Enablement\n\n#### {{< var IFs.easy-understand >}}\n\n\"Make guidance easier to understand\" was written as a solution to help authors who misinterpret, or can't understand, guidance. Participants suggested developers could \"make guidance as 'plain language' as possible\" os \"create plain language versions of existing guidance\", whilst being \"mindful of language that may appear patronizing\".\n\nParticipants suggested defining \"key words or phrases in a glossary or tooltips\", using consistent terms across related resources, translating guidelines and examples, and ensuring these translations are easy to find by making them \"searchable\", \"linked properly\" to each other, and \"more evident on [the] EQUATOR site\".\n\nParticipants recognised a need to collect and respond to feedback from \"international researchers\" representative of the user base across disciplines and institutions, and that this could be sought when developing guidance to \"test\" it, but also on an ongoing basis to \"continually revisit the items in the guidelines that may be confusing or difficult to implement\". As an example, one guideline developer contributed that collecting feedback had lead them to remove \"the word 'context' because users struggled to understand it\".\n\nIntervention Functions: Education, enablement\n\n#### {{< var IFs.persuade >}}\n\nWhen discussing how authors feel about reporting guidelines and checklists, participants reflected on how the wording and presentation of resources can influence authors' perceptions of it.\n\nParticipants noted that a poorly formatted checklist, lacking \"visual appeal/graphic design\", can \"appear outdated\" or \"larger than it is\". Participants suggested that developers could use design to \"foster feelings of simplicity\", and \"engage graphic designers\" if necessary.\n\nParticipants suggested rewording text and tone of voice to make reporting guidelines and checklists \"appear less like 'red tape'\", and to reassure authors that \"reporting guidelines are just that: guidelines!\". Participants suggested adding this framing at the top of checklists \"in case people don't read the whole [guideline] paper\".\n\nReassurance seemed especially important when considering how to motivate authors to transparently report items that aren't perfect, and that developers could use language and tone of voice to \"foster a feeling of confidence, not judgement\", perhaps reminding \"researchers that all research has limitations\". Reassurance could also be given by including notes aimed at reviewers, and participants cited JARS as an example \"which explains to reviewers why an author may make certain choices\", thereby educating reviewers whilst reassuring authors that they won't be penalised for transparency.\n\nIntervention Functions: Persuasion\n\n#### {{< var IFs.create-tools >}}\n\nGuidance is commonly detailed in a guideline or _example or elaboration_ article. Developers can also make tools that make guidance easier to apply. The best known example of a tool are checklists which serve as a summary of the guidance and a way of demonstrating compliance to editors. Participants noted that checklists may be easier to use if they are editable (see [{{< var IFs.ready-to-use >}}](@sec-{{< var IFSecs.ready-to-use >}})), and if authors could complete them with \"the relevant text, rather than [the] page/section number\" which can be frustrating to keep updated. (Although one participant, a publisher, noted that checklists completed with text are difficult to double check, and therefore it would be most useful to include the text _and_ the page number).\n\nTo aid writing, participants suggested \"templates for drafting\" manuscripts, interactive forms and \"writing tools (e.g., COBWEB)\", \"tools for creating figures and tables like PRISMA's flowchart generator\", and tools for generating text, like TIDIER's tool for generating intervention description ([#REF](http://www.tidierguide.org/#/author-tool)). However, one participant warned that these kinds of structured writing \"provide opportunities for inclusion [of reporting items] but there is always the risk that they exclude more [important items] that are outside the boundaries of the template\".\n\nTo encourage authors to consider reporting guidance earlier in their research, participants considered to-do lists with items \"in the order they are done\", or \"embed[ing] items into data collection tools\" like software for systematic reviewers.\n\nTo help reviewers check reporting, participants suggested creating \"tools for co-researchers to check each others' work\", creating extra guidance for peer reviewers, providing text that can be pasted in reviewer feedback forms to \"request additional information\" for poorly reported items, or even building a \"reviewer tool that generates a report\".\n\nParticipants noted that tools should presented in ways that \"better differentiate\" how and when they should be used \"e.g., resources for writing vs. checking vs. reviewing\".\n\nIntervention Functions: Enablement\n\n#### {{< var IFs.findable-resources >}}\n\nParticipants had ideas for how to help authors discover and find  resources.\n\nParticipants wrote about links being an important way for authors to discover related guidelines and tools. These could be \"horizontal links between related guidelines\" and between guideline \"documents and tools\" like checklists and templates. All resources should \"link to one another\", ideally \"item by item\" so that checklist items could link directly to the relevant section of full guidance. Participants noted that hyperlinks can become out of date, and so stakeholders should \"fix broken links\".\n\nParticipants also wrote that resources could be hosted on \"a convenient place, such as a unified website\". EQUATOR's website is one such place, and participants suggested making it \"easier to navigate\" and its \"search tool more prominent and easier to use\". One participant wrote that if a guideline's \"scope is clearly defined that will help search tools\" <!-- consider removing to Discussion-->and that when related guidelines have similar names they can benefit from search spillovers. For instance, PRISMA-P may be more likely to appear in a Google search for PRISMA than SPRIT is to appear in a search for CONSORT, simply because of the name similarity. <!-- to here -->\n\nAlthough some authors will use such search tools, participants recognised that those who browse may benefit from \"curated\" collections of reporting guidelines by study type to create a \"manageable list of related, commonly used guidelines\". As an example, an author writing a review article may be helped by a page listing \"PRISMA, MOOSE, ENTREQ, PRISMA-SRc etc.\" and that \"this page could be kept up to date as guidelines are revised\". Another participant (a publisher) warned, however, that journals may not want to link to these pages if the collection has \"a much broader scope\" and includes guidelines that the journal doesn't endorse.\n\nFinding the right guidance is difficult for authors who are less familiar with study designs. One participants suggested creating \"tools to help researchers identify study designs (e.g., a questionnaire)\", and another, already familiar with such a tool previously developed by EQUATOR suggested it should \"use plain language\".\n\nIntervention Functions: Environmental restructuring\n\n#### {{< var IFs.information-architecture >}}\n\nParticipants acknowledged that authors may use guidance in different ways; some will read the whole thing from start to finish, whilst others will dip in and out as-and-when they need. Similarly, different users will have different needs depending on their task (drafting, checking, reviewing) or stage of research (planning or writing up). Consequently, participants wrote that \"having different options available that meet the needs of different users is vital\" and that users should be able to consult guidance in ways that \"work for them\".\n\nOne suggested way of doing this may be to \"structure guidance using navigation menus and subheadings\" so that \"it is easy to find the information you need\", making reporting guidelines faster to use and less overwhelming. Another noted that checklists can also be designed, citing TIDIER as \"a nice example. They have integrated the intervention and placebo into one table\" with the active intervention and placebo in adjacent columns.\n\nDynamically hiding and showing content was floated here again (see [{{< var IFs.keep-short >}}](@sec-{{< var IFSecs.keep-short >}})), with one participant suggesting that users could \"filter out\" irrelevant content, to only see instructions for their task (e.g. planning, writing, reviewing) or specific to their study. This could be done with a \"decision tree\" or \"branching questions\" to determine specific features of the study (\"e.g., a systematic review _with_ network meta-analysis _of_ individual participant data\"). Answers to these questions could then be used to to \"modify\" items to create \"personalised guidelines\", or to generate a \"customised reporting checklist\" that includes all \"main and relevant extension items\".\n\nDynamic content was also seen as a favourable way to embed guideline extensions, with the aim of making them easier to discover without overwhelming the author. For example, noting that \"some guidelines 'fit together'...e.g., PRISMA and PRISMA-Abstracts\", participants wrote that PRISMA-Abstracts could be \"embedded\", perhaps as collapsed content that interested authors could expand.\n\nIntervention Functions: Enablement\n\n### {{< var stages.dissemination >}}\n\n#### {{< var IFs.value-statement >}}\n\nWhen introducing reporting guidelines participants suggested telling authors what reporting guidelines are, \"when and how best to use\" them, and what benefits to expect. This information could go wherever authors are advised to use reporting guidelines (like like journal instruction pages, registries), EQUATOR's website, social media campaigns, at the start of the guidelines, and could go at the beginning of checklists too \"in case people don't read the whole [guideline] paper\". This introductory text could be \"short, sweet, and to the point\". Benefits could be even more prominent by putting them \"in a box, or [by using] font or positioning\".\n\n<!-- #TODO: The quote above about in case people don't read the full guidance was included elsewhere -->\n\nNoting that it might not be obvious how or when to use guidance, participants suggested being explicit about this. For example, \"tell authors that they don’t need to fill out templates [or checklists] sequentially but can use an order that matches their workflow or decision making. Put this instruction on the template, checklists, and other tools. Example from PRISMA – population and subgroup items are separated in the checklist but go together when thinking/making decisions.\". Similarly, authors could benefit from explicit suggestions of how to use reporting guidelines as a team, perhaps by asking \"their co-researchers to check their reporting\".\n\n<!-- #TODO: check that personal benefits are included elsewhere. E.g., Researchers report caring more about personal, immediate benefits compared to hypothetical benefits to others; More transparent reporting / structured reporting may lead to faster editorial processes as it becomes easy for peer reviewers and editors to review papers about their study, Provide statistics about processing times of articles that follow / don’t follow reporting standards. Emphasise to researchers that clear reporting will minimise the number of times others contact them for clarification -->\n\nIntervention Functions: Education\n\n#### {{< var IFs.accessible >}}\n\nParticipants wrote \"Ensure guidance is open access\" as a potential solution to two problems. First, it would ensure that  authors can access guidance even if they don't have a journal subscription. Secondly, if guidance is published under a permissive license then others can reuse the content to extend the guidance or build new tools.\n\nIntervention Functions: Enablement\n\n#### {{< var IFs.citation >}}\n\nDisplaying citation counts on the EQUATOR Network website (or other websites where authors search for reporting guidelines) was described as a way to \"provide social proof\" and convince first time users that guidelines are credible.\n\nTo generate these citations, participants suggested explicitly asking \"researchers to cite the guideline they used\", noting that authors may not unless instructed. Participants wrote that if an author cites a guideline they have used, then readers may discover the guideline from that authors' article. One participant suggested \"highlighting RG items in the manuscript so that it becomes more visible that a RG has been used and that it has helped the creation of a report\".\n\nIntervention Functions: Persuasion, Education\n\n#### {{< var IFs.testimonials >}}\n\nParticipants suggested providing \"testimonials\" as a potential solution to a few different barriers. These could be short quotes or longer case studies, and their purpose would be to educate and persuade authors.\n\nParticipants suggested providing \"quotes from authors/researchers who felt that reporting guidelines helped their work and who have had positive experiences\" such as making \"writing easier\" or helping \"with co-authorship communications\".  Participants proposed that testimonials could bring benefits to life, thereby making them more believable.\n\nTo make authors care more about research waste caused by poor reporting, participants suggested testimonials from \"research consumers for whom an item is important\", or quotes that illustrate \"how detrimental poor reporting is for end users\".\n\nParticipants wrote that testimonials from decision makers (like editors, reviewers, and grant-givers) could communicate their \"preference for transparent reporting\" and convince authors that reporting will be checked. If these testimonials conveyed that transparency is valued above perfectionism, participants suggested this could reassure authors. Participants also suggested collecting testimonials from such \"nervous researchers\".\n\nFinally, participants suggested collecting testimonials from researchers \"with a range of experience\", including \"experienced researchers who have benefited by changing their practices\". Diverse case studies would help engage a diverse user base, and challenge assumptions that reporting guidelines are too patronizing for experienced researchers or too complicated for inexperienced ones.\n\nIntervention Functions: Modelling, Persuasion\n\n### {{< var stages.ongoing >}}\n\n#### {{< var IFs.budget-and-fund-reporting >}}\n\nParticipants noted that \"researchers need budget to allocate time to writing\" and that \"funders could encourage proper financial/time budgeting for writing\", as could research supervisors.\n\nIntervention Functions: Enablement\n\n#### {{< var IFs.create-rewards >}}\n\nParticipants suggested \"offer[ing] some sort of tangible reward/benefit\" to motivate guideline use, creating new rewards when necessary. Ideas included \"publishers offering a fast-track review/discount\", \"badges on published articles\" or platforms \"like publons\", or \"a certificate after completing training\".\n\nIntervention Functions: Incentivization\n\n#### {{< var IFs.create-spaces >}}\n\nMultiple barriers lead participants suggesting to \"create spaces for researchers to connect with other researchers to celebrate and share experiences\". These spaces could include \"forums, meetings, tea clubs, [and] clinics both in real life and virtual\".\n\nSuch spaces could help authors solicit help and could act as social proof, as seeing \"others using and talking about the guidance\" may be motivational.\n\nOnline discussion spaces were also considered a useful way to gather feedback from users directly (by asking for it) and indirectly (by monitoring discussions). Providing feedback channels \"could be useful to guideline developers\", and may also \"cultivate a feeling of community ownership\" by \"communicating an invitational attitude\", thereby making guidelines appear less like red tape imposed by a faceless bureaucracy.\n\n<!-- #TODO: make sure consulting user groups, and SQUIRE quotes included in updating guidance section. \"\n\n\"How can we enable users to give feedback on guidance?\nResearchers have opinions on how the guidance could be improved including how to make it clearer, and whether items should be rearranged, separated, combined, added or removed. \nThis information could be useful to guideline developers\"\n\"Allow researchers to give user feedback and ask questions\n\"Developers could consult different user groups when creating guidance to make sure all users understand it as intended\"\n\"Engage as many health professions as possible to use and share examples of guidelines\n\"Provide ways for researchers to give feedback to guideline developers\"\n\"Make it easier for guideline developers to update guidance\"\n\"Minor updates could be made without publishing a new article\"\n\"Engage as many health professions and editors as possible\"\n\nCommunicating an invitational attitude among colleagues in various settings is powerful as an extender of the user community\"\n\"Downregulating hierarchy is useful – nationally, gender, issues, professional disciplines\"\n\"Allow researchers to give feedback on guidelines to cultivate a feeling of community ownership\" -->\n\nIntervention Functions: Persuasion, Enablement\n\n#### {{< var IFs.early-acquisition >}}\n\nParticipants thought of ways to \"try and shift the time at which researchers discover or use guidelines\", hypothesising that \"it’s more likely that guidelines will save them time\" if used earlier or \"at the right time\" and \"not just upon submission\".\n\nMost simply, participants suggested “telling” or “encouraging” authors visiting the EQUATOR Network website to use reporting guidelines for planning or drafting research (and not just for demonstrating compliance upon submission). Building upon this, participants suggested organising the website to make it obvious which stages of work resources can be used for.\n\nParticipants suggested \"including [reporting guidelines] in the university teaching and training curriculum and text books\" so that students learn about them before running or writing up their first study.\n\nParticipants suggested creating reporting guidance for early research outputs like funding applications and protocols (see [{{< var IFs.create-early-guidance >}}](@sec-{{< var IFSecs.create-early-guidance >}})), and advertising resources through funders, ethics committees, and writing training programmes.\n\nWhen considering whether authors may need reminders to use a reporting guideline for their next study, participants suggested publishers and EQUATOR could use \"email reminders\" or strategies used by e-commerce sites \"like when you buy something from an online business...then they work hard to gain your custom again\" via automated campaigns.\n\nIntervention Functions: Education, enablement, environmental-restructuring\n\n#### {{< var IFs.endorse-enforce >}}\n\nParticipants suggested \"encouraging more journals to endorse guidelines\" and drew a distinction between endorsing reporting guidelines and promoting them on a website, social media, or email (see [{{< var IFs.promote >}}](@sec-{{< IFSecs.promote >}})). Endorsement was described as a long term commitment to recommend or encourage guideline use, requiring buy-in from organisational leaders, and possibly changes to policies, instructions, infrastructure, and workflows. Promotion, conversely, could be ephemeral and does not require organisational changes.\n\nAnother distinction was drawn between endorsement and enforcement, whereby reporting guidelines are \"a requirement\" or \"condition\". Enforcement was further divided into enforcing checklist completion or, noting that checklists may not always accurately reflect manuscript content, checking text for adherence to guidance.\n\nWhen considering _who_ could enforce guidelines, participants noted that reporting guidelines could be \"a requirement for publication\", \"for registration (where applicable) (e.g. clinical trial registries, PROSPERO)\", or when submitting conference abstracts. \"Ethics committees and funding organisations\" could require that adhere to guidelines, \"for example, completion of SPIRIT for clinical trial submissions\", or to declare that they will use a guideline when writing their results. Participants suggested that the software academics use to provide funders with updates could ask for completed checklists. One participant suggested that reporting guideline adherence should be a condition of university employment.\n\nNoting that enforcement requires resources, participants suggested to \"focus on main RGs and being compliant with them\" or to create \"digital dashboard to help audit and monitoring\".\n\nIntervention Functions: Education, restriction, persuasion\n\n#### {{< var IFs.evidence-benefits >}}\n\nParticipants suggested that benefits may be more believable if there were evidenced. Most fundamentally, this could be \"evidence that [reporting guidelines] improve the completeness and transparency of the output\". For quantifiable benefits, the suggestion was to collect and report data on “acceptance rates, publishing speed, writing speed”. One participant posited that \"more transparent reporting / structured reporting may lead to faster editorial processes as it becomes easy for peer reviewers and editors to review papers about their study\" and another suggested to \"provide statistics about processing times of articles that follow / don’t follow reporting standards. Emphasise to researchers that clear reporting will minimise the number of times others contact them for clarification\".\n\nHowever, some participants were sceptical whether data on acceptance rates would show any benefit at all: \"Likelihood of being accepted might not be heavily influenced – bad research well reported would still be rejected\".\n\nFor experiential benefits that cannot be quantified, participants suggested providing case studies or testimonials (see [{{< var IFs.testimonials >}}](@sec-{{< var IFSecs.testimonials >}})).\n\nIntervention Functions: Persuasion, education\n\n#### {{< var IFs.apparent-priority >}}\n\nWhen a journal endorses or enforces reporting guidelines, participants suggested making reporting guidelines more prominent within the journal's workflow to make them appear more important. Notes included that \"reporting guidelines could be more prominent on journal author guideline pages\", or that \"if the journal uses any sort of structured peer review (e.g., specific questions related to methodology) to tell authors this explicitly [on author guideline pages and within review feedback] and link it to the reporting guideline content\". A third suggestion was that \"when journals ‘stitch’ or ‘build’ together the manuscript pdf (including cover letter, manuscript main text, appendices, etc.), prioritise the reporting guideline or move it earlier in the pdf\".\n\nHowever, a few participants (publishers) warned that prioritising guidelines on author instruction pages \"is complicated as these [pages] already have to do a lot\", although guidelines could be more prominent if the pages \"were better organised and/or filterable\".\n\nIntervention Functions: Persuasion\n\n#### {{< var IFs.promote >}}\n\nParticipants wrote that all stakeholders could help spread the word that reporting guidelines exist. Promotion was considered different to endorsement, as it doesn't require the promoting party to have a policy in place or any other role in research production. For example, \"professional societies\" could \"advertise\" reporting guidelines, despite not having a role in the funding, regulation or dissemination of research.\n\nPromotion could occur online. Most obviously, on stakeholder guidance web pages. \"Email campaigns, social media, blogs\" could be useful channels to \"share and connect with others [and] drive traffic to guideline website[s]\", but \"these require time and energy\" from the reporting guideline community to set up and manage.\n\n\"Conferences and workshops at institutions\" were cited as channels to promote reporting guideline offline, as were \" seminars, webinars, and presentations\" especially in \"hard to reach countries/fields\". These events were described as useful ways \"to assist in the interpretation and use of the guidelines\" and could be opportunities for \"universities/funders/journals [to speak] together about the importance of reporting guidelines\".\n\nTo reach students, participants suggested that universities could include reporting guidelines in their curricula, learning materials, or through reporting champions (see [{{< var IFs.reporting-champions >}}](@sec-{{< var IFSecs.reporting-champions >}})).\n\nParticipants wrote that \"promotion can begin before a guideline has been published so that researchers know about guidelines being developed\" and suggested \"the provision of a time buffer/phasing period for updating new reporting guidelines which would allow researchers to have information about these new guidelines\".\n\nIntervention Functions: Education\n\n#### {{< var IFs.reporting-champions >}}\n\nParticipants suggested that all stakeholders could have members to promote and facilitate the usage of reporting guidelines, centring on the terms \"champions\" and \"EQUATOR ambassadors\". Within publishers, funders, or ethics board, a champion's responsibility may be to \"expand knowledge/awareness of guidelines\". Within institutions, champions could also \"help researchers\" by \"providing feedback on writing\" and that ECRs may feel most comfortable talking with a champion from \"an accessible level (e.g., post-doc, library staff)\". This could follow a local network model (UKRN was cited as an example) with EQUATOR as the central organiser, and could utilize existing reproducibility networks.\n\nIntervention Functions: Education, enablement\n\n#### {{< var IFs.support >}}\n\nParticipants proposed additional teaching as a way to promote reporting guidelines, make them easier to use, and a way to communicate the impacts of poor reporting. Education and training could be general (EQUATOR's publication school was cited as an example) of could be \"guideline-specific\", and could be delivered in person or online, as courses, videos, or text.\n\nIn addition to learning about a particular guideline, students could learn about \"writing as a process\" and \"workflows for documenting and communicating research\". This was seen as useful as \"researchers don’t necessarily understand that reporting is a stage in the research process\". Curricula could include \"methods studies that indicate the research waste\" to teach students why reporting matters, or students could learn for themselves by attempting \"to replicate a study or do a systematic review to discover how poorly research is currently reported\".\n\nTo gain experience in using reporting guidelines, participants suggested students could develop \"research protocols (as Bachelor or Master Theses) using reporting guidelines\" and that these could \"be assessed based on the compliance with the appropriate reporting guideline\" in addition to \"other criteria more related with methodology\". To make this easier, participants suggested structuring courses around reporting guideline items \"for example: a course on [randomized controlled trials] covering every single SPIRIT or CONSORT item\".\n\n<!-- #TODO consider moving \"understanding that reporting is a stage of work\" to the budgeting section? -->\n\nIntervention Functions: Education, training\n\n#### {{< var IFs.updating >}}\n\nParticipants acknowledged that \"researchers have opinions on how the guidance could be improved including how to make it clearer, and whether items should be rearranged, separated, combined, added or removed\" and that \"this information could be useful to guideline developers\". Some participants went further, expressing that guidance and websites should be updated \"in response to user feedback or changes in the field\". This idea differs from the others in that it focusses on the behaviour of reporting guideline _developers_, not users, but I include it as it is a natural extension of many other ideas.  \n\nOne developer wrote \"how can we enable users to give feedback on guidance?\", whilst another wrote \"provide ways for researchers to give feedback to guideline developers\" without forwarding any ways to do this. Others suggested that \"developers could consult different user groups when creating guidance\" and \"engage as many health professions as possible\" so that \"professional cultural issues can be usefully accommodated.\"\n\nOnce feedback has been collected, one developer suggested that \"minor updates could be made without publishing a new article\" if the guidance were disseminated on a website. Many guideline developers noted that they required access to extra funding to evaluate, refine, and update their resources.\n\nIntervention Functions: Enablement\n\n\n\n# Discussion\n\n## Description of findings\n\n<!-- \n* short summary of the main findings\n* include some interpretation of the data in the context of previous findings, experiences, theory, or a guiding paradigm or approach.\n* The discussion provides authors an opportunity to:\n  * elaborate on their findings in relation to their research question(s) and study purpose(s);\n  * connect their findings to prior empirical work, theories, and/or frameworks; \n  * and discuss implications:\n    * describe how findings contribute to or advance the field\n    * Implications may include transferability, or specifying the appropriate scope for generalization of the findings beyond the study (e.g., to other settings, populations, time periods, circumstances).\n-->\n\n### Summary of results\n\nParticipants identified {{< var counts.ideas >}} ideas employing all intervention functions. There were ideas to consider before, during, and after creating guidance, ideas to consider when writing the guidance down into a guideline, ideas about tools to help guidance application, ideas about ongoing activities to support or promote guidance use, and ideas about refining guidance over time in response to feedback. Many of these ideas could be enacted by guideline developers, publishers, and EQUATOR, but participants also saw opportunities for ethics committees, funders, academics, registries, and syllabus writers; stakeholders who are typically less frequently considered.\n\n### Relation to study purpose\n\nMy objective was to identify ideas of how to address factors that may influence adherence to reporting guidelines, and I believed that including perspectives from a range of stakeholders would lead to more ideas. This seems to be the case: before this study, I had thought of {{< var counts.jh_ideas >}} ideas, EQUATOR staff then extended this to {{< var counts.EQUATOR_ideas >}}, still far below the number finally identified. \n\nMy second aim was to garner stakeholder buy-in. I had a fair response rate from guideline groups and of those that did respond the reception was positive, even if they were unable to take part. Multiple guideline developers volunteered their guideline to be a \"guinneapig\" and expressed support for my work. Most developers were accepting of the barriers I presented. Only one developer expressed scepticism that reporting guidelines were anything but perfect, and requested additional evidence of authors' negative experiences.\n\n### Relations to previous findings\n<!-- \n#ASK: some interpretation of the data in the context of previous findings, experiences, theory, or a guiding paradigm or approach?? Not sure about this -->\nWhere the barriers I identified previously offer explanations for why previous intervention studies (#REF) have had disappointing results, the ideas generated here provide hypotheses for how these interventions could be improved, and who could improve them.\n\n### Benefits of the BCW\n\nUsing the intervention function and policy categories as a guide was an effective way to prompt discussion when participants ran out of ideas or repeatedly focussed on the same type of intervention that had already been documented.\n\nThe framework also helped guideline developers detach themselves from their creations and look at them objectively. This was a relief, as I had worried that developers may feel defensive or criticised. Keeping discussion focussed on guidelines _in general_ (not theirs in particular), having evidence for barriers, and including mixed perspectives within groups, also helped.\n\n### Interpretations\n\nTwo questions divided participants more than others; whether reporting guidelines should be agnostic to design choices, and whether they should be viewed as rules (standards or requirements), or just a point in the right direction (guidance). The term 'guideline' is used ambiguously in scholarly publishing. NICE defines clinical guidelines as 'recommendations', which is in line with the Cambridge dictionary definition: \"information intended to advise people on how something should be done\". Thus guidelines \"advise\" or \"recommend\" but don't enforce or legislate. However, _journal author guidelines_ can be perceived as _rules_ that researchers have to adhere to if they want to publish, synonymous with _instructions_. Some participants were concerned that reporting guidelines may be perceived as rules, and that authors should be reassured that \"guidelines are just that: guidelines!\". Conversely, a few participants argued strongly that reporting guidelines should be seen as rules.\n\nThese divisions over whether guidelines are guides or rules, and whether they should include opinions about design, may reflect differences between the scope of reporting guidelines, and the perspective of developers. For example, some reporting guidelines cover specific types of study that are homogenous in design and approach (e.g. ontology and epistemology). In this instance, developers may feel comfortable making assumptions or recommendations about design choices, and may be more likely to consider guidelines as standards that can be enforced. In comparison, developers of guidelines with a broader scope may have purposefully tried to not make assumptions about design or approach in an attempt to accommodate studies that share a single feature (e.g. population or method) but vary in all others, such as their design or ontology.\n\nThe division could also reflect variation in developers' aims. Transparency may be the end goal for most, but others may consider reporting standards to be a stepping stone towards influencing (what they consider to be) good design.\n\n<!-- #ASK: connect their findings to prior empirical work, theories, and/or frameworks -->\n\n### Implications\n\n#### Contributions to the field\n\nThis is the first time a Behaviour Change framework has been used to identify ways to encourage the application of reporting guidance. It is an important step in the journey towards an evidence based intervention underpinned with theory. It's also the first time that different guideline developers have come together with publishers and academics to consider reporting guidance dissemination as a system. \n\nThese results will be of use to the reporting guideline community. Developers may find inspiration here when writing or revising guidance. At the time of writing, the EQUATOR Network was in the process of updating its advice for guideline developers, which I hope will be informed by these results. The ideas generated may also be of interest to publishers, funders, and Universities. And, of course, Within my DPhil, it is the groundwork for subsequent chapters.\n\n#### Transferability\n\nAlthough only a few reporting guideline development groups took part in this study, most ideas identified were abstract enough to generalise to most reporting guidance, which tend to be developed and distributed in similar ways; (e.g., all development groups will have to consider what guidance to create, its scope, how to communicate it clearly and how to disseminate it). Some ideas may even generalise to other interventions to encourage good research practices (e.g., to communicate personal benefits, not to patronize researchers). Some ideas may generalise to clinical guidelines, although those are better studied.\n\n## Limitations, and future work\n\n### Limitations\n\nThe study may have benefited from more diversity in participants' backgrounds and expertise. All participants were western and proficient in English. Although this is partly a limitation of who writes reporting guideline, we could have sought input from publishing houses that cater to non-western authors. We could have recruited participants from funders, ethics committees, or registries, or experts familiar with user experience of websites or written documents. Broadening the participant pool would certainly have lead to more ideas. For instance, with my background in creating software products, I noticed a few blind spots whilst analysing and writing up the results, which I noted in my reflection diary.\n\nFor example, participants did not consider writing guidance using in active voice, directed at the intended user, an accepted rule-of-thumb in marketing and used by NICE (#REF). Nor did they consider optimizing resources for search engines. This would make them easier to find, and could be a way to encourage earlier use. For example, EQUATOR's website ranks highly in Google searches for \"STROBE checklist\" but not \"How to write an observational epidemiology study\" (#REF).\n\nMy focus groups were smaller than I had planned.Some would consider these group sizes too small to be called focus groups, and may instead call them paired interviews, dyads, or triads ([#REF](https://www.aqr.org.uk/glossary/triad)). A hallmark of focus groups is that they use \"group interaction to produce data\" @l.morganFocusGroupsQualitative1997, and these interactions may include sharing experiences and challenging each other. \n\nHowever, I did not feel the small group sizes to be a limitation in this study for two reasons. Firstly, participants had deep understandings of the topic (evidenced by sessions overrunning and participants dwelling on a single topic) which meant that even pairs of participants had plenty to discuss, share, and debate. If I had condensed participants into, say, 3 groups of 5-6 participants, each participants would have had less time to speak and I anticipate that many ideas would have gone un-spoken. Secondly, because participants were co-editing a file and building upon the thoughts of previous groups, participants could react and respond to to participants from previous groups.  \n\n### Future work\n\nWe purposefully did not seek input from authors as this study required input from experts familiar with reporting guideline dissemination. We will explore authors' perspectives in future work.\n\nWe also made no attempt to prioritize ideas. This prioritization should be done be each stakeholder individually as it is subjective (what is practical for one may be impractical for another). In my next chapter I describe how I worked with EQUATOR to prioritise ideas and turn them into intervention components. \n\n---\nformat: \n    html:\n        css:\n            styles.css\ntheme: cosmo\ntitle: (Re)designing the intervention\nproject: \n    preview:\n        port: 4200\n        browser: false\n---\n\n# Turning reporting guidelines into a behaviour change intervention: Behavioural analysis and development process\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe output of my focus groups was a long list of ideas. This list included ideas from all stakeholders, including myself, and fed into step 7 of Michie et al.'s guide to applying the Behaviour Change Wheel @michieBehaviourChangeWheel2014. In chapter (see {{< var chapters.workshops >}}) I explained why I expanded on this step. In this chapter I describe my process in more detail by explaining how I used behavioural analysis to identify behaviour change techniques. I then describe how I turned ideas into intervention components and developed these components into an intervention prototype. By intervention component, I mean a designed element that uses one or more behaviour change technique, which is theorized to work through one or more intervention functions to target one or more behavioural drivers. An intervention _change_ is the addition or removal of an element. Defining intervention content in this way is useful because it helps intervention developers to understand why the component has been added (or removed), how it is theorised to be working and, therefore, how its effectiveness may be tested.\n\n## Behavioural Analysis\n\n#### Methods\n\nFor every idea generated from the workshops and focus groups, I labelled which barriers it was addressing, which behavioural drivers it was targeting, and which intervention functions it was employing to do so. This list was data driven, in that it was based upon the ideas and barriers generated from previous research (see chapters {{< var chapters.synthesis >}}, {{< var chapters.review >}}, {{< var chapters.web-audit >}}, {{< var chapters.journal-audit >}}, {{< var chapters.workshops >}} and {{< var chapters.focus-groups >}}). To give structure and context to this list, I grouped ideas according to the sub-behaviours they targeted: 1) engaging with guidance and 2) applying it (see section on identifying the target behaviour in chapter {{< var chapters.workshops >}}).\n\nOnce all ideas were coded, I selected ideas to implement by considering a) whether they could be incorporated into a web-based intervention, b) the priority of the intervention function (determined in objective 2), and c) whether I could feasibly deliver the idea within the time constraints of my DPhil.\n\n#TODO: my results table currently includes _all_ ideas at the moment. But some of these ideas aren't actually intervention components (some are modes of delivery e.g. \"provide training\" or \"networks of champions\"). And I've not included all of the ideas in my intervention. Given that I already report all \"ideas\" in the appendix (and results section of the focus group chapter), I think it might be more useful to just report the intervention components that I've taken forward into the pilot or _could_ include in the website going forward.\n\n#### Results\n\nSee table @tbl-int-plan for all {{< var counts.ideas >}} ideas, labelled with the barriers they address, the drivers they target, the intervention functions they use, and whether I could implement them.\n\n### Building the intervention\n\n#### Purpose\n\nThe result of my behavioural analysis was a list of components that were abstract. “Reassuring language” or “design that communicates simplicity” could be realised in many different ways. To build a working prototype that could be piloted I had to make these real.\n\n#### Methods and Results\n\n##### Designing the intervention\n\nI began by describing how each intervention component could be realised and how this compared to the existing system (see #tab-int-plan). In doing these comparisons, I looked at how the EQUATOR website is currently, and I made generalisation about how popular reporting guidelines are disseminated, and the content of their Example and Elaboration documents and checklists.\n\nDesigning was iterative and collaborative. I included the same members of EQUATOR UK that had participated in the workshops. We met 3 times between November 2022 and January 2023 to discuss intervention design. In our first meeting, we decided which webpages required redesigning, and how webpages should be navigated. On the existing website, authors starting on the home page must visit up to 5 webpages to reach the full reporting guidance. Many authors leave at each step and so few reach the guidance. We redesigned this workflow to reduce this journey to 2 webpages - the EQUATOR home page, and a reporting guideline page containing the full guidance. These different website layouts are visualised in @fig-sankey-b4 and @fig-sankey-after.\n\nWorkshop participants then sketched ideas for how the home page and guidance pages could be laid out and where intervention components could be placed. Once participants had agreed on a layout, I created an alpha version of the new website and invited members to comment on it. These were webpages that could be viewed in a browser, but used dummy text and images. After another round of feedback I refined the alpha version, populated it with real text and images, and participants gave feedback again. The new pages can be viewed in @fig-home, @fig-rg-intro, and @fig-discussion, and can be compared with the old pages in @fig-home-b4 and @fig-db-b4.\n\nMy intention was to create guideline pages for a sample of the most frequently accessed guidelines so that the website felt real for pilot participants. However, many intervention components involved changing the wording and layout of the guidance itself. Editing multiple guidelines was neither feasible not necessary, as we only needed one edited guideline to pilot the new website.\n\nI selected SRQR as my test guideline to edit because I was familiar with it, having used it when writing up my own research, and because I felt it would make a good guideline to test with (see next chapter for why). I got written permission from Bridget O'Brien, the lead developer or SRQR, and from the publisher. I kept Bridget up to date with my work and invited her feedback.\n\nI began editing SRQR by pasting the text into Microsoft Word and rearranging content into categories: what to write, how/where to write it, what to write if the item wasn't/couldn't be done, why the item is important and to whom, examples. I edited sentences to speak directly to authors. E.g. \"Describe X\" instead of \"Authors should describe X\", and to use active voice. This shortened the text and made it clearer that the primary audience is authors.\n\nFor composite items I split the sub-items into bulleted lists. E.g.\n\n> For each X, describe:\n>\n> * X\n> * Y\n> * Z\n>\n\nI rearranged conditional sub-items so that they read \"If X, then describe Y\", rather than \"Describe Y if X\". I moved definitions into the glossary and contextual information into notes. I edited the resulting text to join it back together. I edited the tone of voice to add reassuring language. An example of the redesigned guidance can be viewed in #sec-box-item.\n\nAfter development, I double checked the intervention against the initial list of intervention components to ensure I had covered all of them. I consulted with EQUATOR members to verify that the components were realised as expected and invited another round of feedback.\n\n##### System architecture\n\nWhen considering architecture options I prioritized technology that could feasibly be maintained by EQUATOR staff or a future PhD student. I looked for tools that would be familiar to early career researchers. I considered DIY website builders (like Wix or Squarespace) but these services can be expensive. Most offer a 'drag and drop' building experience which, although easy to use, is a laborious way of uploading and formatting large amounts of content. Should EQUATOR want to change how an item is presented, they would have to manually edit each item for each reporting guideline. Additionally, our intended intervention changes required custom functionality that wasn't offered by these services (e.g. integration with a DOI minting service, glossary definitions, discussion boards).\n\nAlthough coding languages like `html` or `javascript` are used by many software developers to create websites, few early career researchers are familiar with them. I decided on `markdown`, an incredibly simple language that can be learnt in a few minutes. It uses asterisks, underscores, and carets to make text **\\*\\*bold\\*\\***, _\\_italic\\__, or ^\\^superscript\\^^. Headings, URLS, and references are similarly easy, and can be simplified further by using one of many readily available editors that make writing markdown feel like writing a Microsoft Word document.\n\nMany researchers write reproducible manuscripts in markdown using tools like RStudio or Quarto. Quarto can turn markdown into many different file formats including docx, pdf, and html (a website). Quarto documents can be further customised using programming languages commonly used in research, like Ruby or Python. Quarto requires no technical knowledge, is easy to learn, has great documentation, and is open source.\n\nThe website is served using Github Pages which is free, beginner friendly, configurable, and integrates (almost) seamlessly with Github's version control system which will already be familiar to many researchers. I wanted EQUATOR to have ultimate control over the website. I also wanted guideline developers to have selective access to edit their own guideline content but not to other guidelines. I have built the website such that each reporting guideline is stored in its own repository on Github, accessible only to its developers. These guideline repositories are then \"pulled in\" to the main EQUATOR repository, so EQUATOR can double check changes that developers make before allowing them to go live on the site.\n\nThe website source code can be viewed at {{< var website-github-repo-url >}} and the website can be viewed at {{< var website-url >}}.\n\n\n \n:::{.column-page-right}\n\n{{< pagebreak >}}\n\n\n\n::: {.landscape}\n\n['docx-landscape.lua', '_quarto.yml', 'chapters.txt', '.DS_Store', 'chapters', 'references.bib', 'create_variables.py', 'output', '__init__.py', '__pycache__', 'index.qmd', 'springer-vancouver.csl', '.luarc.json', 'ResultsForParticipants.qmd', '.gitignore', '.ipynb_checkpoints', 'ResultsForInternal.qmd', 'venv', '_variables.yml', '.git', '.vscode', 'thesis.code-workspace', 'data', '_freeze', '.quarto', 'gantt.qmd', '.markdownlint.json', 'index.ipynb', 'reference.docx']\n+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| INTERVENTION INGREDIENT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | INT.

Every reporting item now has its own discussion page where authors can ask and answer questions, and provide feedback to guideline developers. ](figures/discussion-page.png){#fig-discussion height=150mm}\n\n\n\n## Discussion\n\nI have demonstrated how I have used a data-driven approach, guided by behaviour theory, to re-design how reporting guidance is disseminated. I have proposed {{< var counts.redesign.intervention-components >}} intervention components, addressing {{< var counts.redesign.barriers-targeted >}} barriers and employing {{< var counts.redesign.intervention-functions-used >}} intervention functions. By linking components with barriers and functions, I have justified my suggestions using evidence and described how they are theorized to work. I have then created a prototype website to demonstrate how these components could be realised.\n\nTogether, these changes amount to a complete redesign of two key parts of the existing system through which reporting guidelines are currently disseminated; the guidelines themselves, and the EQUATOR Network website which is visited by almost 1 million authors each year.\n\n### When comparing current intervention\n\nThis reassessment required participants to take a step back and look at the current set-up with fresh eyes. We did this informally. Some participants shared long-standing frustrations with the website or guidelines. One participant shared designs she had created years ago for a redesigned EQUATOR website. Other times, after discussing a barrier or idea, we would go to the guidelines to see how things are  done currently.\n\nSo this comparison was ad-hoc, and I have included pieces of it in this chapter purely to provide context to the proposed changes. I sought out examples of a behaviour change technique being implemented, not being implemented, or being implemented poorly. I made generalisations about RGs using words like \"some\" or \"few\" to give an impression of how frequently RGs currently use a given BCT. These frequency descriptions are based on my own observation, and not on a formal audit.\n\nI considered systematically auditing the content of EQUATOR Network website and popular guidelines to see which behaviour change techniques they employ and which of our ideas were already present. I decided against this  for two reasons. Firstly, with so many  ideas and so many guidelines, this would have taken time and I decided instead to prioritize building and testing a prototype. Secondly, this audit wouldn't have dramatically influenced the intervention components we designed, but would merely quantify how different my proposed intervention is to the current set-up. Who would be interested in quantifying this difference? Perhaps my thesis examiners, and perhaps the guideline development community. But quantifying differences wouldn't bring me any further towards helping authors or impacting reporting quality, like building a prototype would. Should the guideline development community need that evidence then this audit could be done in the future once the redesigned intervention has been refined (see next chapter) and finalised.\n\n### Limitations & reflections on process\n\nUsing a framework and a systematic method helped participants (and I) to check our biases. Instead of relying on personal preference, we tried to ensure choices reflected the function we were trying to employ. For example, when choosing a background image, instead of asking \"do you like this one?\", the questions became \"what feelings do you think this image conveys? Does it communicate simplicity?\". Working as a group helped mitigate individual preferences and peculiarities.\n\nHowever, there is no avoiding the fact that many decisions required a degree of subjectivity and, as lead researcher, designer, and developer, often these decisions landed on my shoulders. I tried to mitigate this by involving EQUATOR members in the workshops and development process, prioritizing their ideas over my own, and providing many opportunities for feedback. But the result definitely has my “stamp”. If someone else had built it using the same table of intervention components then some things might be the same (like simplifying the user journey from 5 steps to 2, or the conventional layout of the home page) but other things would look very different (like the choice of wording and images).\n\nUsing a framework also helped participants to consider options that may not have otherwise come to mind. However, our imagination may have been constrained by what already exists. Although I encouraged blue-sky thinking, participants often focussed on tweaking what already exists instead of starting from a blank slate. If reporting guidelines didn't exist, how else might we have tackled poor reporting? If EQUATOR didn't exist, would we have a similar organisation to fill its place? How might that organisation be structured, governed, and what kind of legal entity might it be? If the publishing industry didn't exist, might we have imagined different ways of describing research that were more formulaic than free-form articles?\n\nThese imagination constraints may be a weakness, but they are also al practical. EQUATOR is in a privileged position that in that it is known and trusted by publishers, guideline developers, and many authors. Thousands of journals and authors already use reporting checklists. So whilst the changes proposed in this chapter (and the ideas proposed in the chapter before) may be criticised for not being radical enough, for an organisation (and a PhD student) with limited time and resources, it makes sense to improve a system that already has significant buy-in from the academic community, over and above destroying that system or trying to create a new one from scratch.\n\nOur horizons may have also been limited by group-think. If I were to repeat the work, I would have included a small, diverse group of authors to take part in the design process. I would have invited representatives from the publishing industry, funding community, and people more familiar with designing digital behavioural interventions. Including these diverse, informed voices in the design process could have lead to more radical design choices.\n\nI did, however, include guideline developers in the design process. When editing SRQR I made sure to include Bridget O'Reilly, SRQR's lead author, in every step. I explained my process and invited her feedback during and after editing. The experience was very positive. Bridget was supportive of what I was doing and liked the end result. But I acknowledge that other guideline developers may feel protective over their writing, and that many may not have the time nor funding to revise their guidance. I discuss these limitations further in my discussion chapter.\n\nEditing SRQR revealed another limitation: gaps in item description. There was often no guidance of what to write if an item wasn't or couldn't be done. For instance, the target sample size item had no instruction of what to write if you didn't ever have a target in mind. Some items were missing any kind of justification of why the item was important and to whom. Bridget and I both felt that filling these blanks would require time and input from SRQR's development team, and so I left these gaps unfilled for now.\n\n### Future work\n\nI anticipate similar gaps for other reporting guidelines, and would seek to work alongside guideline developers to fill them and I upload other popular reporting guidelines and edit items into a consistent structure using the same process as for SRQR. Further development work will be required before the new website can be made live. Some of this work are technical tasks that, although necessary, do not have behavioural impact. For example, I will need to integrate the new website as a subdomain of EQUATOR's existing one, and I will create automated tests that run before each deployment. However, other tasks _do_ appear on the list of intervention ideas, and will affect behaviour. For example, I intend to optimise each guideline page so that it ranks highly in search engines.\n\nBeyond the intervention components presented here, the prioritization exercise identified other ideas that EQUATOR would like to implement, but that I chose not to act upon. For example, participants favoured developing training resources specific to individual reporting items, and creation of network of “reporting champions”, akin to the UKRN model. EQUATOR participants liked the idea of lobbying funders to require reporting guidelines be used for applications. The work in this chapter could be used to support funding applications to support these endeavours.\n\nI mentioned earlier that one limitation of this study was that authors weren't included in the design process. In the next chapter, I explain how I have addressed this by piloting the website amongst authors.\n\n\n\n\n\n# Pilot\n\n# Discussion\n\n# References\n\n::: {#refs}\n:::\n\n# Appendices {.unnumbered}\n\n# Barriers\n\n{{ include \"../../data/barriers.md\"}}\n\n# Ideas\n\n{{ include \"../../data/iv_changes.md\"}}\n\n",
