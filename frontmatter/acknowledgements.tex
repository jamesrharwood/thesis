Many people influenced my capability, opportunity, and motivation throughout my DPhil, and without them my journey would have been a lot harder.

I am extremely grateful to Professor Gary Collins, Dr. Charlotte Albury, Dr. Jennifer de Beyer, and Dr. Michael Schl√ºssel for their expert supervision and for giving me the tools I needed to explore new paths. I would like to thank my colleagues Jacqueline, Patricia, Paula, and Shona for making me feel part of the team, and I'd like to thank Caroline for welcoming me to the world of reporting guidelines and always being ready to put the world to rights. I thank my family and partner for encouraging me throughout this endeavour, and for giving me the support and space to complete it.

Finally, I thank Cancer Research UK for funding my research.
